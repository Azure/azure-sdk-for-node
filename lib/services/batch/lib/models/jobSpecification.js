class JobSpecification {
  /**
   * Create a JobSpecification.
   * @property {number} [priority] The priority of jobs created under this
   * schedule. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being
   * the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value
   * is 0. This priority is used as the default for all jobs under the job
   * schedule. You can update a job's priority after it has been created using
   * by using the update job API.
   * @property {string} [displayName] The display name for jobs created under
   * this schedule. The name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode
   * characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {boolean} [usesTaskDependencies] Whether tasks in the job can
   * define dependencies on each other. The default is false.
   * @property {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service
   * should take when all tasks in a job created under this schedule are in the
   * completed state. Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all tasks are
   * considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a
   * Job Manager task; if you want to use automatic job termination without a
   * Job Manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to noaction and
   * update the job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once
   * you have finished adding tasks. The default is noaction. Possible values
   * include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
   * @property {string} [onTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should
   * take when any task fails in a job created under this schedule. A task is
   * considered to have failed if it have failed if has a failureInfo. A
   * failureInfo is set if the task completes with a non-zero exit code after
   * exhausting its retry count, or if there was an error starting the task,
   * for example due to a resource file download error. The default is
   * noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction',
   * 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
   * @property {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for
   * the job.
   * @property {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] This is only supported
   * for jobs running on VirtualMachineConfiguration pools. This is of the form
   * /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
   * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
   * Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
   * addresses to accommodate the number of nodes which will run tasks from the
   * job. For more details, see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.
   * @property {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for jobs
   * created under this schedule.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the job does
   * not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and
   * any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason
   * will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there
   * is no time limit on how long the job may run.
   * @property {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
   * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try
   * each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
   * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial
   * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service
   * does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask] The details of a Job Manager task to
   * be launched when a job is started under this schedule. If the job does not
   * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
   * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
   * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
   * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
   * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
   * contain more than 64 characters.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not be unique and
   * can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command line does not
   * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
   * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
   * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
   * example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
   * Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative
   * path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided
   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If the pool that
   * will run this task has containerConfiguration set, this must be set as
   * well. If the pool that will run this task doesn't have
   * containerConfiguration set, this must not be set. When this is specified,
   * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
   * command line is executed in the container.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
   * the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted, the
   * default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
   * element are located in the task's working directory. There is a maximum
   * size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the
   * request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For multi-instance tasks,
   * the files will only be uploaded from the compute node on which the primary
   * task is executed.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.constraints]
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
   * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may
   * run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
   * default is 7 days, i.e. the task directory will be retained for 7 days
   * unless the compute node is removed or the job is deleted.
   * @property {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
   * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
   * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
   * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
   * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and
   * 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1,
   * the Batch service retries the task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the
   * Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete.
   * If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release),
   * those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager
   * task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either use
   * the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or
   * user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
   * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
   * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
   * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime,
   * and using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not
   * to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to
   * false.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs
   * as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @property {boolean} [jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no other tasks
   * will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is
   * running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager
   * on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's
   * concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
   * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences]
   * Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory,
   * not the task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is
   * already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not
   * re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a
   * referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because
   * the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
   * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an
   * authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
   * operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
   * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
   * that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
   * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
   * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
   * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
   * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
   * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
   * contains the task.
   * @property {boolean} [jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The default
   * value is true.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task for jobs
   * created under this schedule. If a job has a Job Preparation task, the
   * Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a compute node before
   * starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any
   * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
   * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
   * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'.
   * No other task in the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task.
   * If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects
   * the request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are
   * calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does
   * not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell
   * features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
   * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
   * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
   * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should
   * use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the
   * Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings] When this is
   * specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
   * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
   * container, all task environment variables are mapped into the container,
   * and the task command line is executed in the container.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.imageName] This
   * is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {array} [jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under
   * this element are located in the task's working directory.  There is a
   * maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is
   * exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {array} [jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.constraints]
   * @property {moment.duration}
   * [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
   * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime]
   * The default is 7 days, i.e. the task directory will be retained for 7 days
   * unless the compute node is removed or the job is deleted.
   * @property {number} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
   * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
   * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
   * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
   * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and
   * 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1,
   * the Batch service retries the task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the
   * Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries
   * the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in
   * the constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully
   * after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the
   * job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to
   * run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the
   * Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can
   * start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is
   * still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task
   * runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task on Windows nodes, or
   * a non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux nodes.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName
   * and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but
   * not both.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName
   * and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but
   * not both.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default
   * value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The
   * Job Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if
   * the Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot
   * occurred while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a
   * Job Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run
   * multiple times. The default value is true.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release task for jobs created
   * under this schedule. The primary purpose of the Job Release task is to
   * undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task. Example
   * activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services that
   * were started as part of job preparation. A Job Release task cannot be
   * specified without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the job. The
   * Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute nodes that have run
   * the Job Preparation task.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
   * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
   * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
   * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
   * the job can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit
   * a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error
   * code TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly,
   * the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command line does not
   * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
   * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
   * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
   * example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
   * Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative
   * path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided
   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings] When this is
   * specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
   * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
   * container, all task environment variables are mapped into the container,
   * and the task command line is executed in the container.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
   * the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted, the
   * default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {array} [jobReleaseTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
   * element are located in the task's working directory.
   * @property {array} [jobReleaseTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.maxWallClockTime]
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.retentionTime] The default is
   * 7 days, i.e. the task directory will be retained for 7 days unless the
   * compute node is removed or the job is deleted.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs
   * as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @property {array} [commonEnvironmentSettings] A list of common environment
   * variable settings. These environment variables are set for all tasks in
   * jobs created under this schedule (including the Job Manager, Job
   * Preparation and Job Release tasks). Individual tasks can override an
   * environment setting specified here by specifying the same setting name
   * with a different value.
   * @property {object} poolInfo The pool on which the Batch service runs the
   * tasks of jobs created under this schedule.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool
   * referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time
   * the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run
   * until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not
   * reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool
   * exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
   * specification, but not both.
   * @property {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
   * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
   * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
   * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
   * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
   * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in
   * unexpected behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
   * specification, but not both.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The
   * Batch service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
   * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
   * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
   * up to 20 characters long.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
   * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
   * @property {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false,
   * the Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
   * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
   * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
   * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
   * option.
   * @property {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The
   * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up
   * to a maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.vmSize] For
   * information about available sizes of virtual machines in pools, see Choose
   * a VM size for compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-pool-vm-sizes).
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
   * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
   * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
   * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
   * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
   * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot
   * be specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
   * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
   * Possible values are:
   * 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
   * 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012.
   * 4 - OS Family 4, equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2.
   * 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows Server 2016. For more information,
   * see Azure Guest OS Releases
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osVersion]
   * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
   * for the specified OS family.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
   * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS
   * VMs. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration are mutually exclusive
   * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
   * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
   * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference]
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.publisher]
   * For example, Canonical or MicrosoftWindowsServer.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.offer]
   * For example, UbuntuServer or WindowsServer.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.sku]
   * For example, 14.04.0-LTS or 2012-R2-Datacenter.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.version]
   * A value of 'latest' can be specified to select the latest version of an
   * image. If omitted, the default is 'latest'.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.virtualMachineImageId]
   * This property is mutually exclusive with other ImageReference properties.
   * The virtual machine image must be in the same region and subscription as

   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
   * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
   * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
   * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
   * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
   * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
   * node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see
   * the 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration]
   * This property must not be specified if the imageReference property
   * specifies a Linux OS image.
   * @property {boolean}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
   * If omitted, the default value is true.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks]
   * This property must be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to
   * have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node
   * gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be
   * attached, each attached disk is empty. When the node is removed from the
   * pool, the disk and all data associated with it is also deleted. The disk
   * is not formatted after being attached, it must be formatted before use -
   * for more information see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/classic/attach-disk#initialize-a-new-data-disk-in-linux
   * and
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-disk-ps#add-an-empty-data-disk-to-a-virtual-machine.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType]
   * This only applies to images that contain the Windows operating system, and
   * should only be used when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes
   * which will be deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is
   * applied. Values are:
   *
   * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
   * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration]
   * If specified, setup is performed on each node in the pool to allow tasks
   * to run in containers. All regular tasks and job manager tasks run on this
   * pool must specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may
   * specify it.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
   * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull".
   * An image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image
   * is fully qualified with an alternative registry.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries]
   * If any images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
   * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
   * @property {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.maxTasksPerNode]
   * The default value is 1. The maximum value of this setting depends on the
   * size of the compute nodes in the pool (the vmSize setting).
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy]
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
   * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
   * @property {moment.duration}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies
   * only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to
   * true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If
   * you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the
   * request with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
   * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {number}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes] This property
   * must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
   * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either
   * targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
   * @property {number}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetLowPriorityNodes] This property
   * must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
   * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either
   * targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
   * @property {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale]
   * If false, at least one of targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes
   * must be specified. If true, the autoScaleFormula element is required. The
   * pool automatically resizes according to the formula. The default value is
   * false.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula]
   * This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It
   * is required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
   * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the
   * Batch service rejects the request with detailed error information.
   * @property {moment.duration}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
   * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes
   * and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
   * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
   * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly,
   * the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {boolean}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
   * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due
   * to deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in
   * the pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] This
   * is of the form
   * /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
   * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
   * Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
   * addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet
   * doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate
   * compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. For pools created with
   * virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
   * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
   * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
   * supported. For more details, see:
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.dynamicVNetAssignmentScope]
   * Possible values include: 'none', 'job'
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration]
   * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
   * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
   * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the
   * maximum number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with
   * HTTP status code 400.
   * @property {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine] The command
   * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
   * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
   * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
   * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
   * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should
   * use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the
   * Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings] When
   * this is specified, all directories recursively below the
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node)
   * are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped
   * into the container, and the task command line is executed in the
   * container.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.imageName]
   * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull".
   * If no tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used
   * as a default.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry]
   * This setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
   * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed
   * under this element are located in the task's working directory.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
   * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.userName] The
   * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
   * one but not both.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
   * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
   * one but not both.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope]
   * The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @property {number}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The
   * Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
   * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
   * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
   * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
   * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
   * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
   * Batch service retries the task without limit.
   * @property {boolean}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
   * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the
   * start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task
   * has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch
   * service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to
   * it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info
   * details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to
   * complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute
   * node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task
   * fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is
   * false.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences] For Windows
   * compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the
   * specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
   * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory
   * and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the
   * task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of
   * 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory
   * (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that
   * directory.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences]
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationLicenses] The list of
   * application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
   * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported,
   * pool creation will fail. The permitted licenses available on the pool are
   * 'maya', 'vray', '3dsmax', 'arnold'. An additional charge applies for each
   * application license added to the pool.
   * @property {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
   * @property {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch
   * service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use
   * of user code.
   * @property {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with
   * each job created under this schedule as metadata. The Batch service does
   * not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
