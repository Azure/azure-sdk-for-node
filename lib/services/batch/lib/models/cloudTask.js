 * the task entered its previous state. This property is not set if the task
 * is in its initial Active state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [commandLine] Gets or sets the command line of the task.

 * subtask after all the subtasks have finished executing the coordianation
 * command line.
 *

 * @member {string} [affinityInfo.affinityId] Gets or sets an opaque string
 * representing the location of a compute node or a task that has run
 * previously.  You can pass the AffinityId of a compute node or task to

 * apply to this task.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] Gets or sets the
 * maximum elapsed time that the task may run, measured from the time the
 * task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the
 * Batch service terminates it.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] Gets or sets the
 * minimum time to retain the working directory for the task on the compute
 * node where it ran. After this time, the Batch service may delete the
 * working directory and all its contents. The default is infinite.
 * 
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Gets or sets the maximum
 * number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task
 * if its exit code is nonzero.

 * elevated mode.
 * 
 * @member {object} [executionInfo] Gets or sets information about the
 * execution of the task.
