/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the CloudTask class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary An Azure Batch task.
 *
 * @member {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the task within the
 * job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including
 * hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 *
 * @member {string} [displayName] A display name for the task. The display name
 * need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum
 * length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [url] The URL of the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [eTag] The ETag of the task. This is an opaque string. You
 * can use it to detect whether the task has changed between requests. In
 * particular, you can be pass the ETag when updating a task to specify that
 * your changes should take effect only if nobody else has modified the task in
 * the meantime.
 *
 * @member {date} [lastModified] The last modified time of the task.
 *
 * @member {date} [creationTime] The creation time of the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [exitConditions] How the Batch service should respond when
 * the task completes.
 *
 * @member {array} [exitConditions.exitCodes]
 *
 * @member {array} [exitConditions.exitCodeRanges]
 *
 * @member {object} [exitConditions.schedulingError]
 *
 * @member {string} [exitConditions.schedulingError.jobAction] The default is
 * none for exit code 0 and terminate for all other exit conditions. If the
 * job's onTaskFailed property is noAction, then specify this property returns
 * an error. The add task request fails with an invalid property value error;;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request). Possible values include: 'none', 'disable', 'terminate'
 *
 * @member {string} [exitConditions.schedulingError.dependencyAction] The
 * default is 'satisfy' for exit code 0, and 'block' for all other exit
 * conditions. If the job's usesTaskDependencies property is set to false, then
 * specifying the dependencyAction property returns an error. The add task
 * request fails with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the
 * REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400  (Bad Request). Possible
 * values include: 'satisfy', 'block'
 *
 * @member {object} [exitConditions.default] Note that the default condition
 * does not include exit code 0. If you want non-default behaviour on exit code
 * 0, you must list it explicitly using the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges
 * collection.
 *
 * @member {string} [exitConditions.default.jobAction] The default is none for
 * exit code 0 and terminate for all other exit conditions. If the job's
 * onTaskFailed property is noAction, then specify this property returns an
 * error. The add task request fails with an invalid property value error;; if
 * you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request). Possible values include: 'none', 'disable', 'terminate'
 *
 * @member {string} [exitConditions.default.dependencyAction] The default is
 * 'satisfy' for exit code 0, and 'block' for all other exit conditions. If the
 * job's usesTaskDependencies property is set to false, then specifying the
 * dependencyAction property returns an error. The add task request fails with
 * an invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly,
 * the HTTP status code is 400  (Bad Request). Possible values include:
 * 'satisfy', 'block'
 *
 * @member {string} [state] The current state of the task. Possible values
 * include: 'active', 'preparing', 'running', 'completed'
 *
 * @member {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the task entered its
 * current state.
 *
 * @member {string} [previousState] The previous state of the task. This
 * property is not set if the task is in its initial Active state. Possible
 * values include: 'active', 'preparing', 'running', 'completed'
 *
 * @member {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] The time at which the task
 * entered its previous state. This property is not set if the task is in its
 * initial Active state.
 *
 * @member {string} [commandLine] The command line of the task. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the command line is executed as the primary task,
 * after the primary task and all subtasks have finished executing the
 * coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and
 * therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
 * variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you
 * should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c
 * MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * download to the compute node before running the command line. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the
 * compute node on which the primary task is executed.
 *
 * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [affinityInfo] A locality hint that can be used by the
 * Batch service to select a compute node on which to start the new task.
 *
 * @member {string} [affinityInfo.affinityId] You can pass the affinityId of a
 * compute node or task to indicate that this task needs to be placed close to
 * the node or task.
 *
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints that apply to this
 * task.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 *
 * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the task runs.
 * If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool - specifies that the
 * task runs as the common auto user account which is created on every node in
 * a pool. task - specifies that the service should create a new user for the
 * task. The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin - The auto
 * user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The auto user is a
 * user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator permissions.
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {object} [executionInfo] Information about the execution of the
 * task.
 *
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.startTime] 'Running' corresponds to the
 * running state, so if the task specifies resource files or application
 * packages, then the start time reflects the time at which the task started
 * downloading or deploying these. If the task has been restarted or retried,
 * this is the most recent time at which the task started running. This
 * property is present only for tasks that are in the running or completed
 * state.
 *
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.endTime] This property is set only if the task
 * is in the Completed state.
 *
 * @member {number} [executionInfo.exitCode] This property is set only if the
 * task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a process
 * reflects the specific convention implemented by the application developer
 * for that process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your
 * code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the application
 * process. However, if the Batch service terminates the task (due to timeout,
 * or user termination via the API) you may see an operating system-defined
 * exit code.
 *
 * @member {object} [executionInfo.schedulingError] This property is set only
 * if the task is in the completed state.
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.category] Possible values
 * include: 'userError', 'serverError', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.code]
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.message]
 *
 * @member {array} [executionInfo.schedulingError.details]
 *
 * @member {number} [executionInfo.retryCount] The task is retried if it exits
 * with a nonzero exit code, up to the specified maxTaskRetryCount.
 *
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.lastRetryTime] This element is present only if
 * the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is
 * typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been
 * restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node was
 * rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime
 * is not.
 *
 * @member {number} [executionInfo.requeueCount] When the user removes nodes
 * from a pool (by resizing/shrinking the pool) or when the job is being
 * disabled, the user can specify that running tasks on the nodes be requeued
 * for execution. This count tracks how many times the task has been requeued
 * for these reasons.
 *
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.lastRequeueTime] This property is set only if
 * the requeueCount is nonzero.
 *
 * @member {object} [nodeInfo] Information about the compute node on which the
 * task ran.
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.affinityId]
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.nodeUrl]
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.poolId]
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.nodeId]
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.taskRootDirectory]
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.taskRootDirectoryUrl]
 *
 * @member {object} [multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that the
 * task is a multi-instance task, and contains information about how to run the
 * multi-instance task.
 *
 * @member {number} [multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances]
 *
 * @member {string} [multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine] A typical
 * coordination command line launches a background service and verifies that
 * the service is ready to process inter-node messages.
 *
 * @member {array} [multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] The difference
 * between common resource files and task resource files is that common
 * resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary,
 * whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary.
 *
 * @member {object} [stats] Resource usage statistics for the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [stats.url]
 *
 * @member {date} [stats.startTime]
 *
 * @member {date} [stats.lastUpdateTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.userCPUTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.kernelCPUTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.wallClockTime] The wall clock time is the
 * elapsed time from when the task started running on a compute node to when it
 * finished (or to the last time the statistics were updated, if the task had
 * not finished by then). If the task was retried, this includes the wall clock
 * time of all the task retries.
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOps]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOps]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOGiB]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOGiB]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.waitTime]
 *
 * @member {object} [dependsOn] The tasks that this task depends on. This task
 * will not be scheduled until all tasks that it depends on have completed
 * successfully. If any of those tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts,
 * this task will never be scheduled.
 *
 * @member {array} [dependsOn.taskIds]
 *
 * @member {array} [dependsOn.taskIdRanges]
 *
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
 * packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
 * running the command line.
 *
 * @member {object} [authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
 * authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service
 * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task
 * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
 * operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
 * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
 * that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
 * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
 * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array} [authenticationTokenSettings.access] The authentication
 * token grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently
 * the only supported value for the access property is 'job', which grants
 * access to all operations related to the job which contains the task.
