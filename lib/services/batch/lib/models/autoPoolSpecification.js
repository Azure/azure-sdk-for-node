class AutoPoolSpecification {
  /**
   * Create a AutoPoolSpecification.
   * @property {string} [autoPoolIdPrefix] A prefix to be added to the unique
   * identifier when a Pool is automatically created. The Batch service assigns
   * each auto Pool a unique identifier on creation. To distinguish between
   * Pools created for different purposes, you can specify this element to add
   * a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be up to 20 characters
   * long.
   * @property {string} poolLifetimeOption The minimum lifetime of created auto
   * Pools, and how multiple Jobs on a schedule are assigned to Pools. Possible
   * values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
   * @property {boolean} [keepAlive] Whether to keep an auto Pool alive after
   * its lifetime expires. If false, the Batch service deletes the Pool once
   * its lifetime (as determined by the poolLifetimeOption setting) expires;
   * that is, when the Job or Job Schedule completes. If true, the Batch
   * service does not delete the Pool automatically. It is up to the user to
   * delete auto Pools created with this option.
   * @property {object} [pool] The Pool specification for the auto Pool.
   * @property {string} [pool.displayName] The display name need not be unique
   * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {string} [pool.vmSize] For information about available sizes of
   * virtual machines in Pools, see Choose a VM size for Compute Nodes in an
   * Azure Batch Pool
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-pool-vm-sizes).
   * @property {object} [pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This property must be
   * specified if the Pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS VMs. This
   * property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive and one of
   * the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then the Batch
   * service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
   * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot be specified
   * if the Batch Account was created with its poolAllocationMode property set
   * to 'UserSubscription'.
   * @property {string} [pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily] Possible
   * values are:
   * 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
   * 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012.
   * 4 - OS Family 4, equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2.
   * 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows Server 2016.
   * 6 - OS Family 6, equivalent to Windows Server 2019. For more information,
   * see Azure Guest OS Releases
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
   * @property {string} [pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osVersion] The default
   * value is * which specifies the latest operating system version for the
   * specified OS family.
   * @property {object} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This property must
   * be specified if the Pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS VMs. This
   * property and cloudServiceConfiguration are mutually exclusive and one of
   * the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then the Batch
   * service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
   * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {object} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference]
   * @property {string}
   * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.publisher] For example,
   * Canonical or MicrosoftWindowsServer.
   * @property {string} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.offer]
   * For example, UbuntuServer or WindowsServer.
   * @property {string} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.sku]
   * For example, 14.04.0-LTS or 2012-R2-Datacenter.
   * @property {string}
   * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.version] A value of
   * 'latest' can be specified to select the latest version of an Image. If
   * omitted, the default is 'latest'.
   * @property {string}
   * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.virtualMachineImageId]
   * This property is mutually exclusive with other ImageReference properties.
   * The Virtual Machine Image must be in the same region and subscription as
   * the Azure Batch Account. For information about the firewall settings for
   * the Batch Compute Node agent to communicate with the Batch service see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.
   * @property {string} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId] The
   * Batch Compute Node agent is a program that runs on each Compute Node in
   * the Pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the
   * Compute Node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of
   * the Compute Node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems.
   * You must specify a Compute Node agent SKU which matches the selected Image
   * reference. To get the list of supported Compute Node agent SKUs along with
   * their list of verified Image references, see the 'List supported Compute
   * Node agent SKUs' operation.
   * @property {object} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration]
   * This property must not be specified if the imageReference property
   * specifies a Linux OS Image.
   * @property {boolean}
   * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
   * If omitted, the default value is true.
   * @property {array} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks] This
   * property must be specified if the Compute Nodes in the Pool need to have
   * empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each Compute
   * Node gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks
   * cannot be attached, each attached disk is empty. When the Compute Node is
   * removed from the Pool, the disk and all data associated with it is also
   * deleted. The disk is not formatted after being attached, it must be
   * formatted before use - for more information see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/classic/attach-disk#initialize-a-new-data-disk-in-linux
   * and
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-disk-ps#add-an-empty-data-disk-to-a-virtual-machine.
   * @property {string} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType] This
   * only applies to Images that contain the Windows operating system, and
   * should only be used when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the
   * Compute Nodes which will be deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing
   * discount is applied. Values are:
   *
   * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
   * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
   * @property {object}
   * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration] If specified,
   * setup is performed on each Compute Node in the Pool to allow Tasks to run
   * in containers. All regular Tasks and Job manager Tasks run on this Pool
   * must specify the containerSettings property, and all other Tasks may
   * specify it.
   * @property {array}
   * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
   * This is the full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull".
   * An Image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the Image
   * is fully qualified with an alternative registry.
   * @property {array}
   * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries]
   * If any Images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
   * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
   * @property {number} [pool.maxTasksPerNode] The default value is 1. The
   * maximum value is the smaller of 4 times the number of cores of the vmSize
   * of the Pool or 256.
   * @property {object} [pool.taskSchedulingPolicy] If not specified, the
   * default is spread.
   * @property {string} [pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] If not
   * specified, the default is spread. Possible values include: 'spread',
   * 'pack'
   * @property {moment.duration} [pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies only
   * to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true.
   * The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you
   * specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the request
   * with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status
   * code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {number} [pool.targetDedicatedNodes] This property must not be
   * specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to
   * false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
   * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
   * @property {number} [pool.targetLowPriorityNodes] This property must not be
   * specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to
   * false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
   * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
   * @property {boolean} [pool.enableAutoScale] If false, at least one of
   * targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must be specified. If true,
   * the autoScaleFormula element is required. The Pool automatically resizes
   * according to the formula. The default value is false.
   * @property {string} [pool.autoScaleFormula] This property must not be
   * specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is required if
   * enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for validity before
   * the Pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch service
   * rejects the request with detailed error information.
   * @property {moment.duration} [pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The default
   * value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and 168
   * hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or greater
   * than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an invalid
   * property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
   * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {boolean} [pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling
   * inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the Pool due to
   * deployment restrictions on the Compute Nodes of the Pool. This may result
   * in the Pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
   * @property {object} [pool.networkConfiguration]
   * @property {string} [pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual
   * network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch
   * Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
   * accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. If the subnet doesn't
   * have enough free IP addresses, the Pool will partially allocate Nodes, and
   * a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
   * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
   * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must
   * allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule
   * Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
   * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
   * Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service
   * will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created
   * with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
   * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for Pools created
   * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
   * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security
   * Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
   * communication. For Pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
   * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389
   * for Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable
   * ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure
   * Storage on port 443. For more details see:
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
   * @property {string} [pool.networkConfiguration.dynamicVNetAssignmentScope]
   * Possible values include: 'none', 'job'
   * @property {object} [pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool
   * endpoint configuration is only supported on Pools with the
   * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
   * @property {array}
   * [pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools] The
   * maximum number of inbound NAT Pools per Batch Pool is 5. If the maximum
   * number of inbound NAT Pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
   * code 400.
   * @property {object} [pool.startTask]
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.commandLine] The command line does not
   * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
   * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
   * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
   * example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
   * Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative
   * path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided
   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [pool.startTask.containerSettings] When this is
   * specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
   * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
   * container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container,
   * and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in
   * the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to
   * the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access
   * those files.
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
   * the full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted, the
   * default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.workingDirectory] The
   * default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include:
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {array} [pool.startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
   * element are located in the Task's working directory.
   * @property {array} [pool.startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object} [pool.startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the Task runs
   * as a non-administrative user unique to the Task.
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {object} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is Task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @property {number} [pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service
   * retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
   * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try
   * the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
   * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial
   * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service
   * does not retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
   * service retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start
   * Task fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the start Task up to its
   * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be
   * detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false,
   * the Batch service will not wait for the start Task to complete. In this
   * case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the start
   * Task is still running; and even if the start Task fails, new Tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is false.
   * @property {array} [pool.certificateReferences] For Windows Nodes, the
   * Batch service installs the Certificates to the specified Certificate store
   * and location. For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a
   * directory inside the Task working directory and an environment variable
   * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this
   * location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
   * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
   * /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that directory.
   * @property {array} [pool.applicationPackageReferences] Changes to Package
   * references affect all new Nodes joining the Pool, but do not affect
   * Compute Nodes that are already in the Pool until they are rebooted or
   * reimaged. There is a maximum of 10 Package references on any given Pool.
   * @property {array} [pool.applicationLicenses] The list of application
   * licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses.
   * If a license is requested which is not supported, Pool creation will fail.
   * The permitted licenses available on the Pool are 'maya', 'vray', '3dsmax',
   * 'arnold'. An additional charge applies for each application license added
   * to the Pool.
   * @property {array} [pool.userAccounts]
   * @property {array} [pool.metadata] The Batch service does not assign any
   * meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
