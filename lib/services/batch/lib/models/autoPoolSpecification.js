/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the AutoPoolSpecification class.
 * @constructor
 * Specifies characteristics for a temporary 'auto pool'. The Batch service
 * will create this auto pool, run all the tasks for the job on it, and will
 * delete the pool once the job has completed.
 * @member {string} [autoPoolIdPrefix] Gets or sets a prefix to be added to
 * the unique identifier when a pool is automatically created. The prefix can
 * be up to 20 characters long.
 * 
 * @member {string} poolLifetimeOption Gets or sets the minimum lifetime of
 * created auto pools, and how multiple jobs on a schedule are assigned to
 * pools. Possible values include: 'jobschedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {boolean} [keepAlive] Gets or sets whether to keep an auto pool
 * alive after its lifetime expires.
 * 
 * @member {object} [pool] Gets or sets the pool specification for the auto
 * pool.
 * 
 * @member {string} [pool.displayName] Gets or sets the display name for the
 * pool.
 * 
 * @member {string} [pool.vmSize] Gets or sets the size of the virtual
 * machines in the pool. All VMs in a pool are the same size.
 * 
 * @member {string} [pool.osFamily] Gets or sets the Azure Guest OS family to
 * be installed on the virtual machines in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {string} [pool.targetOSVersion] Gets or sets the Azure Guest OS
 * version to be installed on the virtual machines in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {number} [pool.maxTasksPerNode] Gets or sets the maximum number of
 * tasks that can run concurrently on a single compute node in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {object} [pool.taskSchedulingPolicy] Gets or sets how tasks are
 * distributed among compute nodes in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {string} [pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] Gets or sets how
 * tasks should be distributed across compute nodes. Possible values include:
 * 'spread', 'pack', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [pool.resizeTimeout] Gets or sets the timeout for
 * allocation of compute nodes to the pool.
 * 
 * @member {number} [pool.targetDedicated] Gets or sets the desired number of
 * compute nodes in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {boolean} [pool.enableAutoScale] Gets or sets whether the pool size
 * should automatically adjust over time.
 * 
 * @member {string} [pool.autoScaleFormula] Gets or sets the formula for the
 * desired number of compute nodes in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] Gets or sets a
 * time interval for the desired AutoScale evaluation period in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {boolean} [pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Gets or sets whether
 * the pool permits direct communication between nodes.
 * 
 * @member {object} [pool.startTask] Gets or sets a task to run on each
 * compute node as it joins the pool. The task runs when the node is added to
 * the pool or when the node is restarted.
 * 
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.commandLine] Gets or sets the command line
 * of the start task.
 * 
 * @member {array} [pool.startTask.resourceFiles] Gets or sets a list of files
 * that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command
 * line.
 * 
 * @member {array} [pool.startTask.environmentSettings] Gets or sets a list of
 * environment variable settings for the start task.
 * 
 * @member {boolean} [pool.startTask.runElevated] Gets or sets whether to run
 * the start task in elevated mode. The default value is false.
 * 
 * @member {number} [pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] Gets or sets the
 * maximum number of times the task may be retried.
 * 
 * @member {boolean} [pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] Gets or sets whether the
 * Batch Service should wait for the start task to complete successfully
 * (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the
 * compute node.
 * 
 * @member {array} [pool.certificateReferences] Gets or sets a list of
 * certificates to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {array} [pool.applicationPackageReferences] Gets or sets the list
 * of application packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
 * 
 * @member {array} [pool.metadata] Gets or sets a list of name-value pairs
 * associated with the pool as metadata.
