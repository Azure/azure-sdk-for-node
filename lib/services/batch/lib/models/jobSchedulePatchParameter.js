/**

class JobSchedulePatchParameter {
  /**
   * Create a JobSchedulePatchParameter.
   * @member {object} [schedule] The schedule according to which jobs will be
   * created. If you do not specify this element, the existing schedule is left
   * unchanged.
   * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
   * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
   * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
   * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
   * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
   * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
   * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job
   * will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule
   * is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval,
   * then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that
   * is 'due' in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next
   * recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1
   * minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the
   * schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
   * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
   * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
   * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
   * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
   * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
   * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
   * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally
   * specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use
   * jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are
   * created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next
   * recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is
   * created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the
   * schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1
   * minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the
   * schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
   * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification] The details of the jobs to be created
   * on this schedule. Updates affect only jobs that are started after the
   * update has taken place. Any currently active job continues with the older
   * specification.
   * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range
   * from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being
   * the highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
   * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's
   * priority after it has been created using by using the update job API.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be
   * unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
   * 1024.
   * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
   * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
   * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
   * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
   * onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set
   * onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks.
   * The default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction',
   * 'terminateJob'
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noaction.
   * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
   * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
   * If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
   * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
   * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
   * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
   * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
   * that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
   * service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
   * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times
   * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the
   * Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
   * Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no
   * retries).
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
   * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
   * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
   * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
   * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain
   * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and
   * underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
   * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
   * 1024.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
   * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
   * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
   * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
   * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
   * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should
   * use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the
   * Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If
   * the pool that will run this task has containerConfiguration set, this must
   * be set as well. If the pool that will run this task doesn't have
   * containerConfiguration set, this must not be set. When this is specified,
   * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
   * command line is executed in the container.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
   * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
   * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
   * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
   * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files
   * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For
   * multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute
   * node on which the primary task is executed.
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints]
   * @member {moment.duration}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is
   * not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
   * @member {moment.duration}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
   * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
   * is removed or reimaged.
   * @member {number}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
   * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
   * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
   * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
   * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and
   * 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1,
   * the Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and
   * application packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a
   * new compute node.
   * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
   * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
   * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
   * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
   * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should
   * either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have
   * a client or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if
   * the Job Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in
   * their execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
   * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime,
   * and using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not
   * to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to
   * false.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If
   * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName]
   * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
   * specify one but not both.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser]
   * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
   * specify one but not both.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
   * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
   * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true,
   * no other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job
   * Manager is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the
   * Job Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally
   * against the node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the
   * node allows multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
   * @member {array}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
   * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
   * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
   * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the
   * existing copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application
   * package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been
   * deleted or because download failed, the task fails.
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
   * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an
   * authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
   * operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
   * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
   * that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
   * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
   * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
   * @member {array}
   * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
   * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
   * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
   * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
   * contains the task.
   * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode]
   * The default value is true.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
   * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
   * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can
   * contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and
   * underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not
   * specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of
   * 'jobpreparation'. No other task in the job can have the same ID as the Job
   * Preparation task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch
   * service rejects the request with error code
   * TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API directly,
   * the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
   * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
   * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
   * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
   * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
   * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths,
   * it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or
   * use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings]
   * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node)
   * are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped
   * into the container, and the task command line is executed in the
   * container.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
   * the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
   * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files
   * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints]
   * @member {moment.duration}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this
   * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
   * @member {moment.duration}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
   * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
   * compute node is removed or reimaged.
   * @member {number}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
   * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
   * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
   * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
   * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and
   * 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1,
   * the Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and
   * application packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a
   * new compute node.
   * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
   * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch
   * service retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as
   * specified in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
   * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
   * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
   * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
   * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks
   * of the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job
   * Preparation task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task
   * fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default
   * value is true.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
   * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task on
   * Windows nodes, or a a non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux
   * nodes.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName
   * and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but
   * not both.
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName
   * and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but
   * not both.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @member {boolean}
   * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The
   * Job Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if
   * the Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot
   * occurred while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a
   * Job Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run
   * multiple times. The default value is true.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
   * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
   * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
   * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
   * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
   * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the
   * compute nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain
   * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and
   * underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not
   * specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of
   * 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job can have the same ID as the Job
   * Release task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch
   * service rejects the request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if
   * you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409
   * (Conflict).
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
   * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
   * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
   * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
   * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
   * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should
   * use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the
   * Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings] When
   * this is specified, all directories recursively below the
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node)
   * are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped
   * into the container, and the task command line is executed in the
   * container.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
   * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
   * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
   * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
   * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.resourceFiles] Files
   * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.environmentSettings]
   * @member {moment.duration}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.maxWallClockTime]
   * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.retentionTime]
   * The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until
   * the compute node is removed or reimaged.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If
   * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName]
   * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
   * specify one but not both.

   * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
   * specify one but not both.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
   * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
   * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @member {array} [jobSpecification.commonEnvironmentSettings] Individual
   * tasks can override an environment setting specified here by specifying the
   * same setting name with a different value.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo]
   * @member {string} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that
   * the pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at
   * the time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job
   * will run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service
   * will not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the
   * pool exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
   * specification, but not both.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto
   * pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state,
   * and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property.
   * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless
   * keepAlive is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that
   * affect the lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result
   * in unexpected behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto
   * pool specification, but not both.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The
   * Batch service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
   * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
   * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
   * up to 20 characters long.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
   * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
   * @member {boolean}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
   * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
   * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
   * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
   * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
   * option.
   * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The
   * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up
   * to a maximum length of 1024.
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.vmSize] For
   * information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services
   * pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud
   * Services
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
   * Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and
   * A2V2. For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from
   * the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with
   * virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux)
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/)
   * or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows)
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/).
   * Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with
   * premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration]
   * This property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure
   * PaaS VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually
   * exclusive and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is

   * @member {boolean}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
   * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due
   * to deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in
   * the pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
   * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
   * Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
   * addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet
   * doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate
   * compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
   * service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
   * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The
   * specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to
   * be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by
   * checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
   * (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is
   * denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute
   * nodes to unusable. For pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only
   * ARM virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported,
   * but for pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic
   * virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated
   * Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be
   * enabled for inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual
   * machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22
   * for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For pools created with a cloud
   * service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable
   * outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

   * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
   * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
   * @member {array}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
   * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the
   * maximum number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with
   * HTTP status code 400.
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
   * @member {string}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
   * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
   * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
   * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
   * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
   * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths,
   * it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or
   * use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @member {object}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings]

   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount]
   * The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that
   * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
   * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
   * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
   * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
   * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
   * Batch service retries the task without limit.
   * @member {boolean}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess]
   * If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
   * retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount).
   * If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then
   * the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule
   * tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure
   * info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task
   * to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute
   * node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task
   * fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is
   * false.
   * @member {array}
   * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
   * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
   * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
   * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory
   * and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the
   * task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of
   * 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory
   * (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that
   * directory.
