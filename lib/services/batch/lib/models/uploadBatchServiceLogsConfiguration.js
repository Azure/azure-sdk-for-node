   * @property {string} containerUrl The URL of the container within Azure Blob
   * Storage to which to upload the Batch Service log file(s). The URL must
   * include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting write permissions to the
   * container. The SAS duration must allow enough time for the upload to
   * finish. The start time for SAS is optional and recommended to not be
   * specified.
   * @property {date} startTime The start of the time range from which to
   * upload Batch Service log file(s). Any log file containing a log message in
   * the time range will be uploaded. This means that the operation might
   * retrieve more logs than have been requested since the entire log file is
   * always uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than
   * have been requested.
   * @property {date} [endTime] The end of the time range from which to upload
   * Batch Service log file(s). Any log file containing a log message in the
   * time range will be uploaded. This means that the operation might retrieve
   * more logs than have been requested since the entire log file is always
   * uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than have been
   * requested. If omitted, the default is to upload all logs available after
   * the startTime.
