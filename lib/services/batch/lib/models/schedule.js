/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the Schedule class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary The schedule according to which jobs will be created
 *
 * @member {date} [doNotRunUntil] The earliest time at which any job may be
 * created under this job schedule. If you do not specify a doNotRunUntil
 * time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 * 
 * @member {date} [doNotRunAfter] A time after which no job will be created
 * under this job schedule. The schedule will move to the completed state as
 * soon as this deadline is past and there is no active job under this job
 * schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [startWindow] The time interval, starting from
 * the time at which the schedule indicates a job should be created, within
 * which a job must be created. If a job is not created within the
 * startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will be
 * created until the next recurrence of the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [recurrenceInterval] The time interval between
 * the start times of two successive jobs under the job schedule. A job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time.
