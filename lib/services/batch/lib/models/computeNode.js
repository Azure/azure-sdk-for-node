 */
class ComputeNode {
  /**
   * Create a ComputeNode.
   * @member {string} [id] The ID of the compute node. Every node that is added
   * to a pool is assigned a unique ID. Whenever a node is removed from a pool,
   * all of its local files are deleted, and the ID is reclaimed and could be
   * reused for new nodes.
   * @member {string} [url] The URL of the compute node.
   * @member {string} [state] The current state of the compute node. The
   * low-priority node has been preempted. Tasks which were running on the node
   * when it was pre-empted will be rescheduled when another node becomes
   * available. Possible values include: 'idle', 'rebooting', 'reimaging',
   * 'running', 'unusable', 'creating', 'starting', 'waitingForStartTask',
   * 'startTaskFailed', 'unknown', 'leavingPool', 'offline', 'preempted'
   * @member {string} [schedulingState] Whether the compute node is available
   * for task scheduling. Possible values include: 'enabled', 'disabled'
   * @member {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the compute node
   * entered its current state.
   * @member {date} [lastBootTime] The time at which the compute node was
   * started. This property may not be present if the node state is unusable.
   * @member {date} [allocationTime] The time at which this compute node was
   * allocated to the pool.
   * @member {string} [ipAddress] The IP address that other compute nodes can
   * use to communicate with this compute node. Every node that is added to a
   * pool is assigned a unique IP address. Whenever a node is removed from a
   * pool, all of its local files are deleted, and the IP address is reclaimed
   * and could be reused for new nodes.
   * @member {string} [affinityId] An identifier which can be passed when
   * adding a task to request that the task be scheduled on this node. Note
   * that this is just a soft affinity. If the target node is busy or
   * unavailable at the time the task is scheduled, then the task will be
   * scheduled elsewhere.
   * @member {string} [vmSize] The size of the virtual machine hosting the
   * compute node. For information about available sizes of virtual machines
   * for Cloud Services pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration),
   * see Sizes for Cloud Services
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
   * Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and
   * A2V2. For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from
   * the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with
   * virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux)
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/)
   * or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows)
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/).
   * Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with
   * premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
   * @member {number} [totalTasksRun] The total number of job tasks completed
   * on the compute node. This includes Job Manager tasks and normal tasks, but
   * not Job Preparation, Job Release or Start tasks.
   * @member {number} [runningTasksCount] The total number of currently running
   * job tasks on the compute node. This includes Job Manager tasks and normal
   * tasks, but not Job Preparation, Job Release or Start tasks.
   * @member {number} [totalTasksSucceeded] The total number of job tasks which
   * completed successfully (with exitCode 0) on the compute node. This
   * includes Job Manager tasks and normal tasks, but not Job Preparation, Job
   * Release or Start tasks.
   * @member {array} [recentTasks] A list of tasks whose state has recently
   * changed. This property is present only if at least one task has run on
   * this node since it was assigned to the pool.
   * @member {object} [startTask] The task specified to run on the compute node
   * as it joins the pool.
   * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
   * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such
   * as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
   * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
   * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If
   * the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path
   * (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided
   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified, all
   * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
   * command line is executed in the container.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the full
   * image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
   * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can
   * be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If
   * omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @member {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this element
   * are located in the task's working directory.
   * @member {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
   * non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value
   * is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
   * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
   * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
   * controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once,
   * and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
   * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
   * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the task without limit.
   * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
   * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to
   * its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition
   * can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the
   * Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case,
   * other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task
   * is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
   * @member {object} [startTaskInfo] Runtime information about the execution
   * of the start task on the compute node.
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.state] Possible values include: 'running',
   * 'completed'
   * @member {date} [startTaskInfo.startTime] This value is reset every time
   * the task is restarted or retried (that is, this is the most recent time at
   * which the start task started running).
   * @member {date} [startTaskInfo.endTime] This is the end time of the most
   * recent run of the start task, if that run has completed (even if that run
   * failed and a retry is pending). This element is not present if the start
   * task is currently running.
   * @member {number} [startTaskInfo.exitCode] This property is set only if the
   * start task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
   * process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application
   * developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make
   * decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention
   * used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates
   * the start task (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may
   * see an operating system-defined exit code.
   * @member {object} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo] This property is set only
   * if the task runs in a container context.
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.containerId]
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.state] This is the state of
   * the container according to the Docker service. It is equivalent to the
   * status field returned by "docker inspect".
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.error] This is the detailed
   * error string from the Docker service, if available. It is equivalent to
   * the error field returned by "docker inspect".
   * @member {object} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo] This property is set only if
   * the task is in the completed state and encountered a failure.
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.category] Possible values
   * include: 'userError', 'serverError'
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.code]
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.message]
   * @member {array} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.details]
   * @member {number} [startTaskInfo.retryCount] Task application failures
   * (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the task could
   * not be run) and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will
   * retry the task up to the limit specified by the constraints.
   * @member {date} [startTaskInfo.lastRetryTime] This element is present only
   * if the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is
   * typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been
   * restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node
   * was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the
   * lastRetryTime is not.
   * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.result] If the value is 'failed', then the
   * details of the failure can be found in the failureInfo property. Possible
   * values include: 'success', 'failure'
   * @member {array} [certificateReferences] The list of certificates installed
   * on the compute node. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs
   * the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For
   * Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the
   * task working directory and an environment variable
   * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
   * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
   * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
   * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
   * @member {array} [errors] The list of errors that are currently being
   * encountered by the compute node.
   * @member {boolean} [isDedicated] Whether this compute node is a dedicated
   * node. If false, the node is a low-priority node.
   * @member {object} [endpointConfiguration] The endpoint configuration for
   * the compute node.
   * @member {array} [endpointConfiguration.inboundEndpoints]
