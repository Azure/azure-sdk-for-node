/**

 */
class ComputeNode {
  /**
   * Create a ComputeNode.
   * @property {string} [id] The ID of the Compute Node. Every Compute Node
   * that is added to a Pool is assigned a unique ID. Whenever a Compute Node
   * is removed from a Pool, all of its local files are deleted, and the ID is
   * reclaimed and could be reused for new Compute Nodes.
   * @property {string} [url] The URL of the Compute Node.
   * @property {string} [state] The current state of the Compute Node. The
   * low-priority Compute Node has been preempted. Tasks which were running on
   * the Compute Node when it was preempted will be rescheduled when another
   * Compute Node becomes available. Possible values include: 'idle',
   * 'rebooting', 'reimaging', 'running', 'unusable', 'creating', 'starting',
   * 'waitingForStartTask', 'startTaskFailed', 'unknown', 'leavingPool',
   * 'offline', 'preempted'
   * @property {string} [schedulingState] Whether the Compute Node is available
   * for Task scheduling. Possible values include: 'enabled', 'disabled'
   * @property {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the Compute Node
   * entered its current state.
   * @property {date} [lastBootTime] The last time at which the Compute Node
   * was started. This property may not be present if the Compute Node state is
   * unusable.
   * @property {date} [allocationTime] The time at which this Compute Node was
   * allocated to the Pool. This is the time when the Compute Node was
   * initially allocated and doesn't change once set. It is not updated when
   * the Compute Node is service healed or preempted.
   * @property {string} [ipAddress] The IP address that other Nodes can use to
   * communicate with this Compute Node. Every Compute Node that is added to a
   * Pool is assigned a unique IP address. Whenever a Compute Node is removed
   * from a Pool, all of its local files are deleted, and the IP address is
   * reclaimed and could be reused for new Compute Nodes.
   * @property {string} [affinityId] An identifier which can be passed when
   * adding a Task to request that the Task be scheduled on this Compute Node.
   * Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target Compute Node is busy
   * or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then the Task will be
   * scheduled elsewhere.
   * @property {string} [vmSize] The size of the virtual machine hosting the
   * Compute Node. For information about available sizes of virtual machines in
   * Pools, see Choose a VM size for Compute Nodes in an Azure Batch Pool
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-pool-vm-sizes).
   * @property {number} [totalTasksRun] The total number of Job Tasks completed
   * on the Compute Node. This includes Job Manager Tasks and normal Tasks, but
   * not Job Preparation, Job Release or Start Tasks.
   * @property {number} [runningTasksCount] The total number of currently
   * running Job Tasks on the Compute Node. This includes Job Manager Tasks and
   * normal Tasks, but not Job Preparation, Job Release or Start Tasks.
   * @property {number} [totalTasksSucceeded] The total number of Job Tasks
   * which completed successfully (with exitCode 0) on the Compute Node. This
   * includes Job Manager Tasks and normal Tasks, but not Job Preparation, Job
   * Release or Start Tasks.
   * @property {array} [recentTasks] A list of Tasks whose state has recently
   * changed. This property is present only if at least one Task has run on
   * this Compute Node since it was assigned to the Pool.
   * @property {object} [startTask] The Task specified to run on the Compute
   * Node as it joins the Pool.
   * @property {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
   * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such
   * as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
   * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
   * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If
   * the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path
   * (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided
   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified,
   * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task
   * command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container
   * outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk,
   * meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
   * full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
   * provided as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can
   * be omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
   * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.workingDirectory] The
   * default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include:
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
   * element are located in the Task's working directory.
   * @property {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the Task runs as a
   * non-administrative user unique to the Task.
   * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
   * value is Task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
   * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries
   * a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
   * controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the Task once,
   * and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
   * count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
   * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start Task
   * fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the start Task up to its
   * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be
   * detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false,
   * the Batch service will not wait for the start Task to complete. In this
   * case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the start
   * Task is still running; and even if the start Task fails, new Tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is false.
   * @property {object} [startTaskInfo] Runtime information about the execution
   * of the start Task on the Compute Node.
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.state] Possible values include:
   * 'running', 'completed'
   * @property {date} [startTaskInfo.startTime] This value is reset every time
   * the Task is restarted or retried (that is, this is the most recent time at
   * which the start Task started running).
   * @property {date} [startTaskInfo.endTime] This is the end time of the most
   * recent run of the start Task, if that run has completed (even if that run
   * failed and a retry is pending). This element is not present if the start
   * Task is currently running.
   * @property {number} [startTaskInfo.exitCode] This property is set only if
   * the start Task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
   * process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application
   * developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make
   * decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention
   * used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates
   * the start Task (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may
   * see an operating system-defined exit code.
   * @property {object} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo] This property is set only
   * if the Task runs in a container context.
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.containerId]
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.state] This is the state
   * of the container according to the Docker service. It is equivalent to the
   * status field returned by "docker inspect".
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.error] This is the
   * detailed error string from the Docker service, if available. It is
   * equivalent to the error field returned by "docker inspect".
   * @property {object} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo] This property is set only
   * if the Task is in the completed state and encountered a failure.
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.category] Possible values
   * include: 'userError', 'serverError'
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.code]
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.message]
   * @property {array} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.details]
   * @property {number} [startTaskInfo.retryCount] Task application failures
   * (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the Task could
   * not be run) and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will
   * retry the Task up to the limit specified by the constraints.
   * @property {date} [startTaskInfo.lastRetryTime] This element is present
   * only if the Task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present,
   * this is typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the Task
   * has been restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the
   * Compute Node was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated
   * but the lastRetryTime is not.
   * @property {string} [startTaskInfo.result] If the value is 'failed', then
   * the details of the failure can be found in the failureInfo property.
   * Possible values include: 'success', 'failure'
   * @property {array} [certificateReferences] The list of Certificates
   * installed on the Compute Node. For Windows Nodes, the Batch service
   * installs the Certificates to the specified Certificate store and location.
   * For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside
   * the Task working directory and an environment variable
   * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this
   * location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
   * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
   * /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that directory.
   * @property {array} [errors] The list of errors that are currently being
   * encountered by the Compute Node.
   * @property {boolean} [isDedicated] Whether this Compute Node is a dedicated
   * Compute Node. If false, the Compute Node is a low-priority Compute Node.
   * @property {object} [endpointConfiguration] The endpoint configuration for
   * the Compute Node.
   * @property {array} [endpointConfiguration.inboundEndpoints]
   * @property {object} [nodeAgentInfo] Information about the Compute Node
   * agent version and the time the Compute Node upgraded to a new version.
   * @property {string} [nodeAgentInfo.version] This version number can be
   * checked against the Compute Node agent release notes located at
   * https://github.com/Azure/Batch/blob/master/changelogs/nodeagent/CHANGELOG.md.
   * @property {date} [nodeAgentInfo.lastUpdateTime] This is the most recent
   * time that the Compute Node agent was updated to a new version.
