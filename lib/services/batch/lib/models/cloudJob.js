/**
 * @summary An Azure Batch Job.
  *
 */
class CloudJob {
  /**
   * Create a CloudJob.
   * @property {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the Job within
   * the Account. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you
   * may not have two IDs within an Account that differ only by case).
   * @property {string} [displayName] The display name for the Job.
   * @property {boolean} [usesTaskDependencies] Whether Tasks in the Job can
   * define dependencies on each other. The default is false.
   * @property {string} [url] The URL of the Job.
   * @property {string} [eTag] The ETag of the Job. This is an opaque string.
   * You can use it to detect whether the Job has changed between requests. In
   * particular, you can be pass the ETag when updating a Job to specify that
   * your changes should take effect only if nobody else has modified the Job
   * in the meantime.
   * @property {date} [lastModified] The last modified time of the Job. This is
   * the last time at which the Job level data, such as the Job state or
   * priority, changed. It does not factor in task-level changes such as adding
   * new Tasks or Tasks changing state.
   * @property {date} [creationTime] The creation time of the Job.
   * @property {string} [state] The current state of the Job. Possible values
   * include: 'active', 'disabling', 'disabled', 'enabling', 'terminating',
   * 'completed', 'deleting'
   * @property {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the Job entered
   * its current state.
   * @property {string} [previousState] The previous state of the Job. This
   * property is not set if the Job is in its initial Active state. Possible
   * values include: 'active', 'disabling', 'disabled', 'enabling',
   * 'terminating', 'completed', 'deleting'
   * @property {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] The time at which the Job
   * entered its previous state. This property is not set if the Job is in its
   * initial Active state.
   * @property {number} [priority] The priority of the Job. Priority values can
   * range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000
   * being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
   * @property {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for the Job.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the Job does
   * not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and
   * any Tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason
   * will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there
   * is no time limit on how long the Job may run.
   * @property {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
   * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try
   * each Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
   * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial
   * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service
   * does not retry Tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries Tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask] Details of a Job Manager Task to be
   * launched when the Job is started.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
   * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
   * contain more than 64 characters.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not be unique and
   * can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command line does not
   * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
   * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
   * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
   * example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
   * Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative
   * path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided
   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If the Pool that
   * will run this Task has containerConfiguration set, this must be set as
   * well. If the Pool that will run this Task doesn't have
   * containerConfiguration set, this must not be set. When this is specified,
   * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task
   * command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container
   * outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk,
   * meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
   * the full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted, the
   * default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.workingDirectory] The
   * default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include:
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
   * element are located in the Task's working directory. There is a maximum
   * size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the
   * request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For multi-instance Tasks,
   * the files will only be uploaded from the Compute Node on which the primary
   * Task is executed.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.constraints]
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
   * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the Task may
   * run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
   * default is 7 days, i.e. the Task directory will be retained for 7 days
   * unless the Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.
   * @property {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
   * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the Task
   * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task
   * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
   * retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and
   * 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1,
   * the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {number} [jobManagerTask.requiredSlots] The default is 1. A Task
   * can only be scheduled to run on a compute node if the node has enough free
   * scheduling slots available. For multi-instance Tasks, this must be 1.
   * @property {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the
   * Job Manager Task completes, the Batch service marks the Job as complete.
   * If any Tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release),
   * those Tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager
   * Task does not affect the Job status. In this case, you should either use
   * the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the Job, or have a client or
   * user terminate the Job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
   * Manager creates a set of Tasks but then takes no further role in their
   * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
   * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control Job lifetime,
   * and using the Job Manager Task only to create the Tasks for the Job (not
   * to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to
   * false.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the Task runs
   * as a non-administrative user unique to the Task.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is pool. If the pool is running Windows a value of Task
   * should be specified if stricter isolation between tasks is required. For
   * example, if the task mutates the registry in a way which could impact
   * other tasks, or if certificates have been specified on the pool which
   * should not be accessible by normal tasks but should be accessible by
   * StartTasks. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @property {boolean} [jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no other Tasks
   * will run on the same Node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If
   * false, other Tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a
   * Compute Node. The Job Manager Task counts normally against the Compute
   * Node's concurrent Task limit, so this is only relevant if the Compute Node
   * allows multiple concurrent Tasks. The default value is true.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences]
   * Application Packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory,
   * not the Task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced Application
   * Package is already on the Compute Node, and is up to date, then it is not
   * re-downloaded; the existing copy on the Compute Node is used. If a
   * referenced Application Package cannot be installed, for example because
   * the package has been deleted or because download failed, the Task fails.
   * @property {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
   * property is set, the Batch service provides the Task with an
   * authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
   * operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided
   * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
   * that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
   * example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to
   * the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.
   * @property {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
   * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
   * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
   * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the Job which
   * contains the Task.
   * @property {boolean} [jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The default
   * value is true.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation Task. The Job
   * Preparation Task is a special Task run on each Compute Node before any
   * other Task of the Job.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any
   * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
   * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
   * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'.
   * No other Task in the Job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation Task.
   * If you try to submit a Task with the same id, the Batch service rejects
   * the request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are
   * calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does
   * not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell
   * features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
   * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
   * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
   * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should
   * use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the
   * Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings] When this is
   * specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
   * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
   * container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container,
   * and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in
   * the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to
   * the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access
   * those files.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.imageName] This
   * is the full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.workingDirectory]
   * The default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include:
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {array} [jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under
   * this element are located in the Task's working directory.  There is a
   * maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is
   * exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {array} [jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.constraints]
   * @property {moment.duration}
   * [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
   * specified, there is no time limit on how long the Task may run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime]
   * The default is 7 days, i.e. the Task directory will be retained for 7 days
   * unless the Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.
   * @property {number} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
   * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the Task
   * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task
   * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
   * retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and
   * 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1,
   * the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the
   * Job Preparation Task fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the Job
   * Preparation Task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
   * constraints element). If the Task has still not completed successfully
   * after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule Tasks of the
   * Job to the Node. The Node remains active and eligible to run Tasks of
   * other Jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
   * Preparation Task to complete. In this case, other Tasks of the Job can
   * start executing on the Compute Node while the Job Preparation Task is
   * still running; and even if the Job Preparation Task fails, new Tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default value is true.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the Task
   * runs as a non-administrative user unique to the Task on Windows Compute
   * Nodes, or a non-administrative user unique to the Pool on Linux Compute
   * Nodes.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName
   * and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but
   * not both.
   * @property {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName
   * and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but
   * not both.
   * @property {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is pool. If the pool is running Windows a value of Task
   * should be specified if stricter isolation between tasks is required. For
   * example, if the task mutates the registry in a way which could impact
   * other tasks, or if certificates have been specified on the pool which
   * should not be accessible by normal tasks but should be accessible by
   * StartTasks. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string}
   * [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default
   * value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The
   * Job Preparation Task is always rerun if a Compute Node is reimaged, or if
   * the Job Preparation Task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot
   * occurred while the Task was running). Therefore, you should always write a
   * Job Preparation Task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run
   * multiple times. The default value is true.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release Task. The Job Release
   * Task is a special Task run at the end of the Job on each Compute Node that
   * has run any other Task of the Job.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
   * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
   * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
   * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other Task in
   * the Job can have the same ID as the Job Release Task. If you try to submit
   * a Task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error
   * code TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly,
   * the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command line does not
   * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
   * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
   * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
   * example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in

   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings] When this is
   * specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
   * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
   * container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container,
   * and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in
   * the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to
   * the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access
   * those files.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
   * the full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no
   * tag is provided as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry] This
   * setting can be omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted, the
   * default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.workingDirectory] The
   * default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include:
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {array} [jobReleaseTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
   * element are located in the Task's working directory.
   * @property {array} [jobReleaseTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.maxWallClockTime]
   * @property {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.retentionTime] The default is
   * 7 days, i.e. the Task directory will be retained for 7 days unless the
   * Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the Task runs
   * as a non-administrative user unique to the Task.
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not

   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
   * default value is pool. If the pool is running Windows a value of Task
   * should be specified if stricter isolation between tasks is required. For
   * example, if the task mutates the registry in a way which could impact

   * should not be accessible by normal tasks but should be accessible by
   * StartTasks. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @property {array} [commonEnvironmentSettings] The list of common
   * environment variable settings. These environment variables are set for all
   * Tasks in the Job (including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and Job
   * Release Tasks). Individual Tasks can override an environment setting
   * specified here by specifying the same setting name with a different value.
   * @property {object} [poolInfo] The Pool settings associated with the Job.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the Pool
   * referenced by this property exists. If the Pool does not exist at the time
   * the Batch service tries to schedule a Job, no Tasks for the Job will run
   * until you create a Pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not
   * reject the Job request; it will simply not run Tasks until the Pool
   * exists. You must specify either the Pool ID or the auto Pool
   * specification, but not both.
   * @property {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto Pool creation
   * fails, the Batch service moves the Job to a completed state, and the Pool
   * creation error is set in the Job's scheduling error property. The Batch
   * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
   * specified, deletion) of the auto Pool. Any user actions that affect the
   * lifetime of the auto Pool while the Job is active will result in
   * unexpected behavior. You must specify either the Pool ID or the auto Pool
   * specification, but not both.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The
   * Batch service assigns each auto Pool a unique identifier on creation. To
   * distinguish between Pools created for different purposes, you can specify
   * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
   * up to 20 characters long.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
   * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
   * @property {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false,
   * the Batch service deletes the Pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
   * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the Job or Job Schedule
   * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the Pool
   * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto Pools created with this
   * option.
   * @property {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The
   * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up
   * to a maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.vmSize] For
   * information about available sizes of virtual machines in Pools, see Choose
   * a VM size for Compute Nodes in an Azure Batch Pool
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-pool-vm-sizes).
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
   * property must be specified if the Pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
   * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
   * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
   * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
   * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot
   * be specified if the Batch Account was created with its poolAllocationMode
   * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
   * Possible values are:
   * 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
   * 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012.
   * 4 - OS Family 4, equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2.
   * 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows Server 2016.
   * 6 - OS Family 6, equivalent to Windows Server 2019. For more information,
   * see Azure Guest OS Releases
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osVersion]
   * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
   * for the specified OS family.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
   * property must be specified if the Pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS
   * VMs. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration are mutually exclusive
   * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
   * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API

   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
   * The Batch Compute Node agent is a program that runs on each Compute Node
   * in the Pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the
   * Compute Node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of
   * the Compute Node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems.

   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks]
   * This property must be specified if the Compute Nodes in the Pool need to
   * have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each
   * Compute Node gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing
   * disks cannot be attached, each attached disk is empty. When the Compute
   * Node is removed from the Pool, the disk and all data associated with it is
   * also deleted. The disk is not formatted after being attached, it must be

   * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration]
   * If specified, setup is performed on each Compute Node in the Pool to allow

   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy] If not
   * specified, the default is spread.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] If
   * not specified, the default is spread. Possible values include: 'spread',
   * 'pack'
   * @property {moment.duration}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies
   * only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to
   * true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If
   * you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the
   * request with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
   * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {number}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes] This property
   * must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
   * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either
   * targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
   * @property {number}

   * Batch service rejects the request with detailed error information.
   * @property {moment.duration}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
   * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes
   * and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
   * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
   * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly,
   * the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @property {boolean}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
   * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the Pool due
   * to deployment restrictions on the Compute Nodes of the Pool. This may
   * result in the Pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is
   * false.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The
   * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
   * Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses
   * to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. If the subnet
   * doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool will partially allocate
   * Nodes and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service
   * principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based
   * Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet
   * must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to
   * schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
   * specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If
   * communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,
   * then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to
   * unusable. For Pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM
   * virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but
   * for Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic
   * virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated
   * Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be
   * enabled for inbound communication. For Pools created with a virtual
   * machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22
   * for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For Pools created with a cloud
   * service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable
   * outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:

   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
   * The maximum number of inbound NAT Pools per Batch Pool is 5. If the

   * 'batchManaged', 'userManaged', 'noPublicIPAddresses'
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.publicIPAddressConfiguration.ipAddressIds]
   * The number of IPs specified here limits the maximum size of the Pool - 100
   * dedicated nodes or 100 low-priority nodes can be allocated for each public
   * IP. For example, a pool needing 250 dedicated VMs would need at least 3
   * public IPs specified. Each element of this collection is of the form:
   * /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/{ip}.
   * @property {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine] The command
   * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
   * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
   * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
   * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
   * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should
   * use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the
   * Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings] When
   * this is specified, all directories recursively below the
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node)
   * are mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped
   * into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the
   * container. Files produced in the container outside of
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning
   * that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
   * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.imageName]
   * This is the full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull".
   * If no tag is provided as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used
   * as a default.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry]
   * This setting can be omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]

   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
   * the Task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the Task.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.userName] The
   * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
   * one but not both.
   * @property {object}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
   * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
   * one but not both.
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope]
   * The default value is pool. If the pool is running Windows a value of Task
   * should be specified if stricter isolation between tasks is required. For
   * example, if the task mutates the registry in a way which could impact
   * other tasks, or if certificates have been specified on the pool which
   * should not be accessible by normal tasks but should be accessible by
   * StartTasks. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
   * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin',
   * 'admin'
   * @property {number}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The
   * Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
   * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
   * try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
   * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one
   * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
   * service does not retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
   * Batch service retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {boolean}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
   * the StartTask fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the StartTask up
   * to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be
   * detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false,
   * the Batch service will not wait for the StartTask to complete. In this
   * case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the
   * StartTask is still running; and even if the StartTask fails, new Tasks
   * will continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is true.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences] For Windows
   * Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the specified
   * Certificate store and location. For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates
   * are stored in a directory inside the Task working directory and an
   * environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to
   * query for this location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser',
   * a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
   * /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that directory.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences] Changes
   * to Package references affect all new Nodes joining the Pool, but do not
   * affect Compute Nodes that are already in the Pool until they are rebooted
   * or reimaged. There is a maximum of 10 Package references on any given
   * Pool.
   * @property {array}
   * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationLicenses] The list of
   * application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
   * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported,
   * Pool creation will fail. The permitted licenses available on the Pool are
   * 'maya', 'vray', '3dsmax', 'arnold'. An additional charge applies for each
   * application license added to the Pool.
   * @property {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
   * @property {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch
   * service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use
   * of user code.
   * @property {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.mountConfiguration]
   * This supports Azure Files, NFS, CIFS/SMB, and Blobfuse.
   * @property {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service
   * should take when all Tasks in the Job are in the completed state. The
   * default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
   * @property {string} [onTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should
   * take when any Task in the Job fails. A Task is considered to have failed
   * if has a failureInfo. A failureInfo is set if the Task completes with a
   * non-zero exit code after exhausting its retry count, or if there was an
   * error starting the Task, for example due to a resource file download
   * error. The default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction',
   * 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
   * @property {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for
   * the Job.
   * @property {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network
   * must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch Account.
   * The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate
   * the number of Compute Nodes which will run Tasks from the Job. This can be
   * up to the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
   * service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
   * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet so that Azure
   * Batch service can schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by
   * checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
   * (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by
   * an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to
   * unusable. This is of the form
   * /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
   * If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG),
   * then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication
   * from the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a Virtual Machine
   * configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux
   * and port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also required to be open for
   * outbound connections for communications to Azure Storage. For more details
   * see:
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
   * @property {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with
   * the Job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to
   * metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
   * @property {object} [executionInfo] The execution information for the Job.
   * @property {date} [executionInfo.startTime] This is the time at which the
   * Job was created.
   * @property {date} [executionInfo.endTime] This property is set only if the
   * Job is in the completed state.
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.poolId] This element contains the actual
   * Pool where the Job is assigned. When you get Job details from the service,
   * they also contain a poolInfo element, which contains the Pool
   * configuration data from when the Job was added or updated. That poolInfo
   * element may also contain a poolId element. If it does, the two IDs are the
   * same. If it does not, it means the Job ran on an auto Pool, and this
   * property contains the ID of that auto Pool.
   * @property {object} [executionInfo.schedulingError] This property is not
   * set if there was no error starting the Job.
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.category] Possible
   * values include: 'userError', 'serverError'
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.code]
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.message]
   * @property {array} [executionInfo.schedulingError.details]
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.terminateReason] This property is set
   * only if the Job is in the completed state. If the Batch service terminates
   * the Job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete - the Job Manager Task
   * completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry
   * - the Job reached its maxWallClockTime constraint. TerminateJobSchedule -
   * the Job ran as part of a schedule, and the schedule terminated.
   * AllTasksComplete - the Job's onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to
   * terminatejob, and all Tasks in the Job are complete. TaskFailed - the
   * Job's onTaskFailure attribute is set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a
   * Task in the Job failed with an exit condition that specified a jobAction
   * of terminatejob. Any other string is a user-defined reason specified in a
   * call to the 'Terminate a Job' operation.
   * @property {object} [stats] Resource usage statistics for the entire
   * lifetime of the Job. This property is populated only if the CloudJob was
   * retrieved with an expand clause including the 'stats' attribute; otherwise
   * it is null. The statistics may not be immediately available. The Batch
   * service performs periodic roll-up of statistics. The typical delay is
   * about 30 minutes.
   * @property {string} [stats.url]
   * @property {date} [stats.startTime]
   * @property {date} [stats.lastUpdateTime]
   * @property {moment.duration} [stats.userCPUTime]
   * @property {moment.duration} [stats.kernelCPUTime]
   * @property {moment.duration} [stats.wallClockTime] The wall clock time is
   * the elapsed time from when the Task started running on a Compute Node to
   * when it finished (or to the last time the statistics were updated, if the
   * Task had not finished by then). If a Task was retried, this includes the
   * wall clock time of all the Task retries.
   * @property {number} [stats.readIOps]
   * @property {number} [stats.writeIOps]
   * @property {number} [stats.readIOGiB]
   * @property {number} [stats.writeIOGiB]
   * @property {number} [stats.numSucceededTasks] A Task completes successfully
   * if it returns exit code 0.
   * @property {number} [stats.numFailedTasks] A Task fails if it exhausts its
   * maximum retry count without returning exit code 0.
   * @property {number} [stats.numTaskRetries]
   * @property {moment.duration} [stats.waitTime] The wait time for a Task is
   * defined as the elapsed time between the creation of the Task and the start
   * of Task execution. (If the Task is retried due to failures, the wait time
   * is the time to the most recent Task execution.) This value is only
   * reported in the Account lifetime statistics; it is not included in the Job
   * statistics.
