/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobReleaseTask class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node
 * where the job has run.
 *
 * @member {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release
 * task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric
 * characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than
 * 64 characters.
 * 
 * @member {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Release task. The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
 * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
 * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
 * 
 * @member {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * download to the compute node before running the command line.
 * 
 * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the Job Release task.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [maxWallClockTime] The maximum elapsed time that
 * the Job Release task may run on a given compute node, measured from the
 * time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit,
 * the Batch service terminates it. The default value is 15 minutes.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [retentionTime] The minimum time to retain the
 * working directory for the Job Release task on the compute node. After this
 * time, the Batch service may delete the working directory and all its
 * contents.  The default is infinite.
 * 
 * @member {boolean} [runElevated] Whether to run the Job Release task in
 * elevated mode. The default value is false.
 *
