/**
 * @summary A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node
 * where the job has run.
  *
 * The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the
 * following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while
 * the job is still active, the job's maximum wall clock time constraint is
 * reached, and the job is still active, or the job's Job Manager task
 * completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager
 * completes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node where tasks of the
 * job have run and the Job Preparation task ran and completed. If you reimage
 * a compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the job ends
 * without any further tasks of the job running on that compute node (and hence
 * the Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release task does
 * not run on that node. If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task
 * is still running, the Job Release task runs again when the compute node
 * starts up. The job is not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks
 * have completed. The Job Release task runs in the background. It does not
 * occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the
 * maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool.

class JobReleaseTask {
  /**
   * Create a JobReleaseTask.
   * @member {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release
   * task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric
   * characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than
   * 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch service
   * assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job can have
   * the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task with the
   * same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
   * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
   * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
   * @member {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Release task. The
   * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
   * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
   * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
   * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
   * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths,
   * it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or
   * use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @member {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container under
   * which the Job Release task runs. When this is specified, all directories
   * recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch
   * directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
   * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
   * line is executed in the container.
   * @member {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These additional
   * options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command, in
   * addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @member {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full image
   * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided
   * as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
   * @member {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be omitted
   * if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @member {string} [containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @member {string} [containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @member {string} [containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @member {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files
   * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
   * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the Job Release task.
   * @member {moment.duration} [maxWallClockTime] The maximum elapsed time that
   * the Job Release task may run on a given compute node, measured from the
   * time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit,
   * the Batch service terminates it. The default value is 15 minutes. You may
   * not specify a timeout longer than 15 minutes. If you do, the Batch service
   * rejects it with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
   * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @member {moment.duration} [retentionTime] The minimum time to retain the
   * task directory for the Job Release task on the compute node. After this
   * time, the Batch service may delete the task directory and all its
   * contents. The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be
   * retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.
   * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the Job
   * Release task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user
   * unique to the task.
   * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @member {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is task.
   * Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default value
   * is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
