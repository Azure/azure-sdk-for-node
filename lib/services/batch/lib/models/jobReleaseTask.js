/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobReleaseTask class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node
 * where the job has run.
 *
 * @member {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release task
 * within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric
 * characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a
 * default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job can have the same id
 * as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the
 * Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * 
 * @member {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Release task. The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 * 
 * @member {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 * 
 * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the Job Release task.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [maxWallClockTime] The maximum elapsed time that
 * the Job Release task may run on a given compute node, measured from the time
 * the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the
 * Batch service terminates it. The default value is 15 minutes. You may not
 * specify a timeout longer than 15 minutes. If you do, the Batch service
 * rejects it with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
 * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [retentionTime] The minimum time to retain the
 * task directory for the Job Release task on the compute node. After this
 * time, the Batch service may delete the task directory and all its contents.
 * The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * 
 * @member {boolean} [runElevated] Whether to run the Job Release task in
 * elevated mode. The default value is false.
 *
