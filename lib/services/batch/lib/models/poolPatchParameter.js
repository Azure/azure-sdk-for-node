/**

class PoolPatchParameter {
  /**
   * Create a PoolPatchParameter.
   * @member {object} [startTask] A task to run on each compute node as it
   * joins the pool. The task runs when the node is added to the pool or when
   * the node is restarted. If this element is present, it overwrites any
   * existing start task. If omitted, any existing start task is left
   * unchanged.
   * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
   * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such
   * as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
   * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
   * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
   * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified, all
   * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
   * command line is executed in the container.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the full
   * image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
   * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can
   * be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If
   * omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @member {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this element
   * are located in the task's working directory.
   * @member {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
   * non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] Values are:
   *
   * pool - specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which
   * is created on every node in a pool.
   * task - specifies that the service should create a new user for the task.
   * The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin
   * - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The
   * auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
   * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
   * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
   * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
   * controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once,
   * and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
   * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
   * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the task without limit.
   * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
   * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to
   * its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition
   * can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the
   * Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case,
   * other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task
   * is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
   * @member {array} [certificateReferences] A list of certificates to be
   * installed on each compute node in the pool. If this element is present, it
   * replaces any existing certificate references configured on the pool. If
   * omitted, any existing certificate references are left unchanged. For
   * Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the
   * specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
   * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory
   * and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the
   * task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of
   * 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory
   * (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that
   * directory.
   * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
   * packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool. Changes to
   * application package references affect all new compute nodes joining the
   * pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until
   * they are rebooted or reimaged. If this element is present, it replaces any
   * existing application package references. If you specify an empty
   * collection, then all application package references are removed from the
   * pool. If omitted, any existing application package references are left
   * unchanged.
   * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
   * pool as metadata. If this element is present, it replaces any existing
   * metadata configured on the pool. If you specify an empty collection, any
   * metadata is removed from the pool. If omitted, any existing metadata is
   * left unchanged.
