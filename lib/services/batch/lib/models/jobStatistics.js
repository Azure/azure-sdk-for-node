class JobStatistics {
  /**
   * Create a JobStatistics.
   * @member {string} url The URL of the statistics.
   * @member {date} startTime The start time of the time range covered by the
   * statistics.
   * @member {date} lastUpdateTime The time at which the statistics were last
   * updated. All statistics are limited to the range between startTime and
   * lastUpdateTime.
   * @member {moment.duration} userCPUTime The total user mode CPU time (summed
   * across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all tasks in the job.
   * @member {moment.duration} kernelCPUTime The total kernel mode CPU time
   * (summed across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all tasks in
   * the job.
   * @member {moment.duration} wallClockTime The total wall clock time of all
   * tasks in the job.  The wall clock time is the elapsed time from when the
   * task started running on a compute node to when it finished (or to the last
   * time the statistics were updated, if the task had not finished by then).
   * If a task was retried, this includes the wall clock time of all the task
   * retries.
   * @member {number} readIOps The total number of disk read operations made by
   * all tasks in the job.
   * @member {number} writeIOps The total number of disk write operations made
   * by all tasks in the job.
   * @member {number} readIOGiB The total amount of data in GiB read from disk
   * by all tasks in the job.
   * @member {number} writeIOGiB The total amount of data in GiB written to
   * disk by all tasks in the job.
   * @member {number} numSucceededTasks The total number of tasks successfully
   * completed in the job during the given time range. A task completes
   * successfully if it returns exit code 0.
   * @member {number} numFailedTasks The total number of tasks in the job that
   * failed during the given time range. A task fails if it exhausts its
   * maximum retry count without returning exit code 0.
   * @member {number} numTaskRetries The total number of retries on all the
   * tasks in the job during the given time range.
   * @member {moment.duration} waitTime The total wait time of all tasks in the
   * job. The wait time for a task is defined as the elapsed time between the
   * creation of the task and the start of task execution. (If the task is
   * retried due to failures, the wait time is the time to the most recent task
   * execution.) This value is only reported in the account lifetime
   * statistics; it is not included in the job statistics.
