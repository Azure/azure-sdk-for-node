/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the Certificate class.
 * @constructor
 * A certificate that can be installed on compute nodes and can be used to
 * authenticate operations on the machine.
 * @member {string} [thumbprint] Get or sets the X.509 thumbprint of the
 * certificate. This is a sequence of up to 40 hex digits (it may include
 * spaces but these are removed).
 * 
 * @member {string} [thumbprintAlgorithm] Gets or sets the algorithm used to
 * derive the thumbprint. This must be sha1.
 * 
 * @member {string} [url] Gets or sets the URL of the certificate.
 * 
 * @member {string} [state] Gets or sets the current state of the certificate.
 * Possible values include: 'active', 'deleting', 'deletefailed'
 * 
 * @member {date} [stateTransitionTime] Gets or sets the time at which the
 * certificate entered its current state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [previousState] Gets or sets the previous state of the
 * certificate. This property is not set if the certificate is in its initial
 * Active state. Possible values include: 'active', 'deleting', 'deletefailed'
 * 
 * @member {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] Gets or sets the time at which
 * the certificate entered its previous state.  This property is not set if
 * the certificate is in its initial Active state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [publicData] Gets or sets the public part of the
 * certificate as a base-64 encoded .cer file.
 * 
 * @member {object} [deleteCertificateError] Gets or sets the error that
 * occurred on the last attempt to delete this certificate.  This property is
 * set only if the certificate is in the deletefailed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [deleteCertificateError.code] Gets or sets an identifier
 * for the certificate deletion error.  Codes are invariant and are intended
 * to be consumed programmatically.
 * 
 * @member {string} [deleteCertificateError.message] Gets or sets a message
 * describing the certificate deletion error, intended to be suitable for
 * display in a user interface.
 * 
 * @member {array} [deleteCertificateError.values] Gets or sets a list of
 * additional error details related to the certificate deletion error.
