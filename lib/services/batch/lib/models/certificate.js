/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the Certificate class.
 * @constructor
 * A certificate that can be installed on compute nodes and can be used to
 * authenticate operations on the machine.
 *
 * @member {string} [thumbprint] The X.509 thumbprint of the certificate. This
 * is a sequence of up to 40 hex digits.
 * 
 * @member {string} [thumbprintAlgorithm] The algorithm used to derive the
 * thumbprint.
 * 
 * @member {string} [url] The URL of the certificate.
 * 
 * @member {string} [state] The current state of the certificate. Possible
 * values include: 'active', 'deleting', 'deletefailed'
 * 
 * @member {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the certificate
 * entered its current state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [previousState] The previous state of the certificate. This
 * property is not set if the certificate is in its initial Active state.
 * Possible values include: 'active', 'deleting', 'deletefailed'
 * 
 * @member {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] The time at which the
 * certificate entered its previous state. This property is not set if the
 * certificate is in its initial Active state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [publicData] The public part of the certificate as a
 * base-64 encoded .cer file.
 * 
 * @member {object} [deleteCertificateError] The error that occurred on the
 * last attempt to delete this certificate. This property is set only if the
 * certificate is in the DeleteFailed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [deleteCertificateError.code]
 * 
 * @member {string} [deleteCertificateError.message]
 * 
 * @member {array} [deleteCertificateError.values] This list includes details
 * such as the active pools and nodes referencing this certificate. However, if
 * a large number of resources reference the certificate, the list contains
 * only about the first hundred.
