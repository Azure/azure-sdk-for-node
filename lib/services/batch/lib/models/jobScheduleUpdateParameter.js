/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobScheduleUpdateParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * Parameters for a CloudJobScheduleOperations.Update request.
 * @member {object} schedule Sets the schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created. If you do not specify this element, it is equivalent to passing
 * the default schedule: that is, a single job scheduled to run immediately.
 * 
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] Gets or sets the earliest time at
 * which any job may be created under this job schedule. If you do not
 * specify a doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs
 * immediately.

 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] Gets or sets a time after which no
 * job will be created under this job schedule.  The schedule will move to
 * the completed state as soon as this deadline is past and there is no
 * active job under this job schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] Gets or sets the time
 * interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates a job
 * should be created, within which a job must be created.  If a job is not
 * created within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost;
 * no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Gets or sets the
 * time interval between the start times of two successive jobs under the job
 * schedule. A job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any
