/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobPreparationTaskExecutionInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * Contains information about the execution of a Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node.
 *
 * @member {date} startTime The time at which the task started running. Note
 * that every time the task is restarted, this value is updated.
 * 
 * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the Job Preparation task
 * completed. This property is set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} state The current state of the Job Preparation task.
 * Possible values include: 'running', 'completed'
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectory] The root directory of the Job
 * Preparation task on the compute node. You can use this path to retrieve
 * files created by the task, such as log files.
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectoryUrl] The URL to the root directory of
 * the Job Preparation task on the compute node.
 * 
 * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the Job Preparation task. This
 * property is set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {object} [schedulingError] The error encountered by the Batch
 * service when starting the task.
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.category] The category of the task
 * scheduling error. Possible values include: 'usererror', 'servererror',
 * 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.code] An identifier for the task
 * scheduling error. Codes are invariant and are intended to be consumed
 * programmatically.
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.message] A message describing the task
 * scheduling error, intended to be suitable for display in a user interface.
 * 
 * @member {array} [schedulingError.details] The list of additional error
 * details related to the scheduling error.
 * 
 * @member {number} retryCount The number of times the task has been retried
 * by the Batch service. Every time the task exits with a non-zero exit code,
 * it is deemed a task failure. The Batch service will retry the task up to
 * the limit specified by the constraints.
 * 
 * @member {date} [lastRetryTime] The most recent time at which a retry of the
 * Job Preparation task started running. This property is set only if the
 * task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero).
 *
