/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobPreparationTaskExecutionInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Contains information about the execution of a Job Preparation task
 * on a compute node.
 *
 * @member {date} startTime The time at which the task started running. Note
 * that every time the task is restarted, this value is updated.
 * 
 * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the Job Preparation task
 * completed. This property is set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} state The current state of the Job Preparation task.
 * Possible values include: 'running', 'completed'
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectory] The root directory of the Job
 * Preparation task on the compute node. You can use this path to retrieve
 * files created by the task, such as log files.
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectoryUrl] The URL to the root directory of
 * the Job Preparation task on the compute node.
 * 
 * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the program specified on the
 * task command line. This parameter is returned only if the task is in the
 * completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific
 * convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If
 * you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that
 * you know the exit code convention used by the application process. Note
 * that the exit code may also be generated by the compute node operating
 * system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.
 * 
 * @member {object} [schedulingError] The error encountered by the Batch
 * service when starting the task.
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.category] Possible values include:
 * 'usererror', 'servererror', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.code]
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.message]
 * 
 * @member {array} [schedulingError.details]
 * 
 * @member {number} retryCount The number of times the task has been retried
 * by the Batch service. Every time the task exits with a non-zero exit code,
 * it is deemed a task failure. The Batch service will retry the task up to
 * the limit specified by the constraints.
 * 
 * @member {date} [lastRetryTime] The most recent time at which a retry of the
 * Job Preparation task started running. This property is set only if the
 * task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero).
 *
