/**
 * @summary Contains information about the execution of a Job Preparation task
 * on a compute node.

 */
class JobPreparationTaskExecutionInformation {
  /**
   * Create a JobPreparationTaskExecutionInformation.
   * @member {date} startTime The time at which the task started running. If
   * the task has been restarted or retried, this is the most recent time at
   * which the task started running.
   * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the Job Preparation task
   * completed. This property is set only if the task is in the Completed
   * state.
   * @member {string} state The current state of the Job Preparation task on
   * the compute node. Possible values include: 'running', 'completed'
   * @member {string} [taskRootDirectory] The root directory of the Job
   * Preparation task on the compute node. You can use this path to retrieve
   * files created by the task, such as log files.
   * @member {string} [taskRootDirectoryUrl] The URL to the root directory of
   * the Job Preparation task on the compute node.
   * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the program specified on the
   * task command line. This parameter is returned only if the task is in the
   * completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific
   * convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If
   * you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that
   * you know the exit code convention used by the application process. Note
   * that the exit code may also be generated by the compute node operating
   * system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.
   * @member {object} [containerInfo] Information about the container under
   * which the task is executing. This property is set only if the task runs in
   * a container context.
   * @member {string} [containerInfo.containerId]
   * @member {string} [containerInfo.state] This is the state of the container
   * according to the Docker service. It is equivalent to the status field
   * returned by "docker inspect".
   * @member {string} [containerInfo.error] This is the detailed error string
   * from the Docker service, if available. It is equivalent to the error field
   * returned by "docker inspect".
   * @member {object} [failureInfo] Information describing the task failure, if
   * any. This property is set only if the task is in the completed state and
   * encountered a failure.
   * @member {string} [failureInfo.category] Possible values include:
   * 'userError', 'serverError'
   * @member {string} [failureInfo.code]
   * @member {string} [failureInfo.message]
   * @member {array} [failureInfo.details]
   * @member {number} retryCount The number of times the task has been retried
   * by the Batch service. Task application failures (non-zero exit code) are
   * retried, pre-processing errors (the task could not be run) and file upload
   * errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the task up to the
   * limit specified by the constraints. Task application failures (non-zero
   * exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the task could not be run)
   * and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the
   * task up to the limit specified by the constraints.
   * @member {date} [lastRetryTime] The most recent time at which a retry of
   * the Job Preparation task started running. This property is set only if the
   * task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is
   * typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been
   * restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node
   * was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the
   * lastRetryTime is not.
   * @member {string} [result] The result of the task execution. If the value
   * is 'failed', then the details of the failure can be found in the
   * failureInfo property. Possible values include: 'success', 'failure'
