/**
 * @summary A Job Preparation task to run before any tasks of the job on any
 * given compute node.
  *
 * You can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the
 * job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading
 * common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job Preparation
 * task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the
 * compute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting a local service
 * on the compute node so that all tasks of that job can communicate with it.
 * If the Job Preparation task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before
 * exiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run tasks of this job on the
 * compute node. The node remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it
 * is reimaged. The node remains active and can be used for other jobs. The Job
 * Preparation task can run multiple times on the same compute node. Therefore,
 * you should write the Job Preparation task to handle re-execution. If the
 * compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is run again on the node
 * before scheduling any other task of the job, if
 * rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task did not
 * previously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job Preparation
 * task is run again before scheduling any task of the job. Batch will retry
 * tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of
 * recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
 * compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure.
 * Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
 * against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an
 * internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all
 * tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.

class JobPreparationTask {
  /**
   * Create a JobPreparationTask.
   * @property {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the Job
   * Preparation task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of
   * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
   * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
   * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task
   * in the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If you try to
   * submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with
   * error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API
   * directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
   * @property {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Preparation
   * task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot
   * take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion.
   * If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the
   * shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows
   * or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file
   * paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working
   * directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container
   * under which the Job Preparation task runs. When this is specified, all
   * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
   * command line is executed in the container.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full image
   * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided
   * as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
   * @property {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
   * omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files
   * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
   * There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size
   * is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the Job Preparation task.
   * @property {object} [constraints] Constraints that apply to the Job
   * Preparation task.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
   * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is 7
   * days, i.e. the task directory will be retained for 7 days unless the
   * compute node is removed or the job is deleted.
   * @property {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
   * specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to
   * a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
   * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
   * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
   * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after
   * the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [waitForSuccess] Whether the Batch service should wait
   * for the Job Preparation task to complete successfully before scheduling
   * any other tasks of the job on the compute node. A Job Preparation task has
   * completed successfully if it exits with exit code 0. If true and the Job
   * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the
   * Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
   * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully
   * after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the
   * job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to
   * run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the
   * Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can
   * start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is
   * still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the Job
   * Preparation task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative
   * user unique to the task on Windows nodes, or a non-administrative user
   * unique to the pool on Linux nodes.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is
   * task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default
   * value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {boolean} [rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] Whether the Batch
   * service should rerun the Job Preparation task after a compute node
   * reboots. The Job Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is
   * reimaged, or if the Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because
   * the reboot occurred while the task was running). Therefore, you should
   * always write a Job Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave
   * correctly if run multiple times. The default value is true.
