/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobPreparationTask class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary A Job Preparation task to run before any tasks of the job on any
 * given compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the Job Preparation
 * task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric
 * characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a
 * default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task in the job can have the
 * same id as the Job Preparation task. If you try to submit a task with the
 * same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API directly,
 * the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Preparation task.
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the Job Preparation task.
 *
 * @member {object} [constraints] Constraints that apply to the Job Preparation
 * task.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [waitForSuccess] Whether the Batch service should wait for
 * the Job Preparation task to complete successfully before scheduling any
 * other tasks of the job on the compute node. If true and the Job Preparation
 * task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job Preparation
 * task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the constraints
 * element). If the task has still not completed successfully after all
 * retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to the
 * compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks of
 * other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still
 * running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue
 * to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the Job
 * Preparation task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative
 * user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool - specifies that the
 * task runs as the common auto user account which is created on every node in
 * a pool. task - specifies that the service should create a new user for the
 * task. The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin - The auto
 * user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The auto user is a
 * user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator permissions.
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] Whether the Batch service
 * should rerun the Job Preparation task after a compute node reboots. The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
