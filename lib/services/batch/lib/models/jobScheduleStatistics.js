 * 
 * @member {date} startTime Gets or sets the start time of the time range
 * covered by the statistics.
 * 
 * @member {date} lastUpdateTime Gets or sets the time at which the statistics
 * were last updated. All statistics are limited to the range between
 * startTime and lastUpdateTime.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} userCPUTime Gets or sets the total user mode CPU
 * time (summed across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all the
 * tasks in all the jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} kernelCPUTime Gets or sets the total kernel mode
 * CPU time (summed across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all
 * the tasks in all the jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} wallClockTime Gets or sets the total wall clock
 * time of all the tasks in all the jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {number} readIOps Gets or sets the total number of I/O read
 * operations performed by all the tasks in all the jobs created under the

 * the schedule.  A task completes successfully if it returns exit code 0.
 * 
 * @member {number} numFailedTasks Gets or sets the total number of tasks that
 * failed during the given time range in jobs created under the schedule. A
 * task fails if it exhausts its maximum retry count without returning exit
