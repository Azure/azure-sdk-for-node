/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobScheduleStatistics class.
 * @constructor
 * Resource usage statistics for a job schedule.
 *
 * @member {string} url The URL of the statistics.
 * 
 * @member {date} startTime The start time of the time range covered by the
 * statistics.
 * 
 * @member {date} lastUpdateTime The time at which the statistics were last
 * updated. All statistics are limited to the range between startTime and
 * lastUpdateTime.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} userCPUTime The total user mode CPU time (summed
 * across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all tasks in all jobs
 * created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} kernelCPUTime The total kernel mode CPU time
 * (summed across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all tasks in
 * all jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} wallClockTime The total wall clock time of all
 * the tasks in all the jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {number} readIOps The total number of disk read operations made by
 * all tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {number} writeIOps The total number of disk write operations made
 * by all tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {number} readIOGiB The total gibibytes read from disk by all tasks
 * in all jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {number} writeIOGiB The total gibibytes written to disk by all
 * tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {number} numSucceededTasks The total number of tasks successfully
 * completed during the given time range in jobs created under the schedule.
 * A task completes successfully if it returns exit code 0.
 * 
 * @member {number} numFailedTasks The total number of tasks that failed
 * during the given time range in jobs created under the schedule. A task
 * fails if it exhausts its maximum retry count without returning exit code 0.
 * 
 * @member {number} numTaskRetries The total number of retries during the
 * given time range on all tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} waitTime The total wait time of all tasks in all
 * jobs created under the schedule. The wait time for a task is defined as
 * the elapsed time between the creation of the task and the start of task
 * execution. (If the task is retried due to failures, the wait time is the
 * time to the most recent task execution.)
