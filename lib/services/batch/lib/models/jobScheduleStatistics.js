class JobScheduleStatistics {
  /**
   * Create a JobScheduleStatistics.
   * @member {string} url The URL of the statistics.
   * @member {date} startTime The start time of the time range covered by the
   * statistics.
   * @member {date} lastUpdateTime The time at which the statistics were last
   * updated. All statistics are limited to the range between startTime and
   * lastUpdateTime.
   * @member {moment.duration} userCPUTime The total user mode CPU time (summed
   * across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all tasks in all jobs
   * created under the schedule.
   * @member {moment.duration} kernelCPUTime The total kernel mode CPU time
   * (summed across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by all tasks in
   * all jobs created under the schedule.
   * @member {moment.duration} wallClockTime The total wall clock time of all
   * the tasks in all the jobs created under the schedule. The wall clock time
   * is the elapsed time from when the task started running on a compute node
   * to when it finished (or to the last time the statistics were updated, if
   * the task had not finished by then). If a task was retried, this includes
   * the wall clock time of all the task retries.
   * @member {number} readIOps The total number of disk read operations made by
   * all tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
   * @member {number} writeIOps The total number of disk write operations made
   * by all tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
   * @member {number} readIOGiB The total gibibytes read from disk by all tasks
   * in all jobs created under the schedule.
   * @member {number} writeIOGiB The total gibibytes written to disk by all
   * tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
   * @member {number} numSucceededTasks The total number of tasks successfully
   * completed during the given time range in jobs created under the schedule.
   * A task completes successfully if it returns exit code 0.
   * @member {number} numFailedTasks The total number of tasks that failed
   * during the given time range in jobs created under the schedule. A task
   * fails if it exhausts its maximum retry count without returning exit code
   * 0.
   * @member {number} numTaskRetries The total number of retries during the
   * given time range on all tasks in all jobs created under the schedule.
   * @member {moment.duration} waitTime The total wait time of all tasks in all
   * jobs created under the schedule. The wait time for a task is defined as
   * the elapsed time between the creation of the task and the start of task
   * execution. (If the task is retried due to failures, the wait time is the
   * time to the most recent task execution.). This value is only reported in
   * the account lifetime statistics; it is not included in the job statistics.
