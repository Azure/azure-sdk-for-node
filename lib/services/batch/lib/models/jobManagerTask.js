/**
 * @summary Specifies details of a Job Manager task.
  *
 * The Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The
 * Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other tasks
 * in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve
 * compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible
 * (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running Job
 * Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the
 * system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle
 * nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the
 * pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager
 * task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have
 * priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities
 * are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be
 * restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job. Batch will retry
 * tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of
 * recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
 * compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure.
 * Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
 * against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an
 * internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all
 * tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.

class JobManagerTask {
  /**
   * Create a JobManagerTask.
   * @property {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager
   * task within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric
   * characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than
   * 64 characters.
   * @property {string} [displayName] The display name of the Job Manager task.
   * It need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a
   * maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Manager task.
   * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
   * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
   * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
   * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
   * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths,
   * it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or
   * use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container
   * under which the Job Manager task runs. If the pool that will run this task
   * has containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If the pool that
   * will run this task doesn't have containerConfiguration set, this must not
   * be set. When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node)
   * are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped
   * into the container, and the task command line is executed in the
   * container.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full image
   * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided
   * as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
   * @property {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
   * omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files
   * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
   * There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size
   * is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {array} [outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will upload from the compute node after running the command line. For
   * multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute
   * node on which the primary task is executed.
   * @property {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the Job Manager task.
   * @property {object} [constraints] Constraints that apply to the Job Manager
   * task.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
   * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
   * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
   * is removed or reimaged.
   * @property {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
   * specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to
   * a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
   * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
   * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
   * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after
   * the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the task without limit. Resource files and application packages
   * are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute node.
   * @property {boolean} [killJobOnCompletion] Whether completion of the Job
   * Manager task signifies completion of the entire job. If true, when the Job
   * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If
   * any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those
   * tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task
   * does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
   * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or
   * user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
   * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
   * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
   * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime,
   * and using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not
   * to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to
   * false.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the Job
   * Manager task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user
   * unique to the task.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is
   * task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default
   * value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {boolean} [runExclusive] Whether the Job Manager task requires
   * exclusive use of the compute node where it runs. If true, no other tasks
   * will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is
   * running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager
   * on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's
   * concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
   * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
   * @property {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
   * packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
   * running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed
   * to a shared directory, not the task working directory. Therefore, if a
   * referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then
   * it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If
   * a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because
   * the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails.
   * @property {object} [authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
   * authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service
   * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task
   * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch
   * service operations without requiring an account access key. The token is
   * provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The
   * operations that the task can carry out using the token depend on the
   * settings. For example, a task can request job permissions in order to add
   * other tasks to the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks
   * under the job.
   * @property {array} [authenticationTokenSettings.access] The authentication
   * token grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations.
   * Currently the only supported value for the access property is 'job', which
   * grants access to all operations related to the job which contains the
   * task.
   * @property {boolean} [allowLowPriorityNode] Whether the Job Manager task
   * may run on a low-priority compute node. The default value is true.
