/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Contains information about the execution of a Job Release task on a
 * compute node.
 *
 * @member {date} startTime The time at which the task started running. Note
 * that every time the task is restarted, this value is updated.
 * 
 * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the Job Release task completed.
 * This property is set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} state The current state of the Job Release task on the
 * compute node. Possible values are: running – the task is currently running
 * (including retrying). completed – the task has exited, or the Batch service
 * was unable to start the task due to scheduling errors. Possible values
 * include: 'running', 'completed'
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectory] The root directory of the Job Release
 * task on the compute node. You can use this path to retrieve files created by
 * the task, such as log files.
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectoryUrl] The URL to the root directory of the
 * Job Release task on the compute node.
 * 
 * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the program specified on the
 * task command line. This parameter is returned only if the task is in the
 * completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific
 * convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If you
 * use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you
 * know the exit code convention used by the application process. Note that the
 * exit code may also be generated by the compute node operating system, such
 * as when a process is forcibly terminated.
 * 
 * @member {object} [schedulingError] The error encountered by the Batch
 * service when starting the task.
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.category] Possible values include:
 * 'usererror', 'servererror', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.code]
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.message]
 * 
 * @member {array} [schedulingError.details]
 *
