/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobReleaseTaskExecutionInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Contains information about the execution of a Job Release task on
 * a compute node.
 *
 * @member {date} startTime The time at which the task started running. Note
 * that every time the task is restarted, this value is updated.
 * 
 * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the Job Release task completed.
 * This property is set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} state The current state of the Job Release task. Possible
 * values include: 'running', 'completed'
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectory] The root directory of the Job Release
 * task on the compute node. You can use this path to retrieve files created
 * by the task, such as log files.
 * 
 * @member {string} [taskRootDirectoryUrl] The URL to the root directory of
 * the Job Release task on the compute node.
 * 
 * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the program specified on the
 * task command line. This parameter is returned only if the task is in the
 * completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific
 * convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If
 * you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that
 * you know the exit code convention used by the application process. Note
 * that the exit code may also be generated by the compute node operating
 * system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.
 * 
 * @member {object} [schedulingError] The scheduling error encountered by the
 * Batch service when starting the task.
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.category] Possible values include:
 * 'usererror', 'servererror', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.code]
 * 
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.message]
 * 
 * @member {array} [schedulingError.details]
