  /**
   * Create a PoolGetOptions.
   * @member {string} [select] An OData $select clause.
   * @member {string} [expand] An OData $expand clause.
   * @member {number} [timeout] The maximum time that the server can spend
   * processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds. Default
   * value: 30 .
   * @member {uuid} [clientRequestId] The caller-generated request identity, in
   * the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g.
   * 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
   * @member {boolean} [returnClientRequestId] Whether the server should return
   * the client-request-id in the response. Default value: false .
   * @member {date} [ocpDate] The time the request was issued. Client libraries
   * typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if
   * you are calling the REST API directly.
   * @member {string} [ifMatch] An ETag value associated with the version of
   * the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if
   * the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value
   * specified by the client.
   * @member {string} [ifNoneMatch] An ETag value associated with the version
   * of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only
   * if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value
   * specified by the client.
   * @member {date} [ifModifiedSince] A timestamp indicating the last modified
   * time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed
   * only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified
   * time.
   * @member {date} [ifUnmodifiedSince] A timestamp indicating the last
   * modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be
   * performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since
   * the specified time.
