   * Create a InboundNATPool.
   * @member {string} name The name of the endpoint. The name must be unique
   * within a Batch pool, can contain letters, numbers, underscores, periods,
   * and hyphens. Names must start with a letter or number, must end with a
   * letter, number, or underscore, and cannot exceed 77 characters.  If any
   * invalid values are provided the request fails with HTTP status code 400.
   * @member {string} protocol The protocol of the endpoint. Possible values
   * include: 'tcp', 'udp'
   * @member {number} backendPort The port number on the compute node. This
   * must be unique within a Batch pool. Acceptable values are between 1 and
   * 65535 except for 22, 3389, 29876 and 29877 as these are reserved. If any
   * reserved values are provided the request fails with HTTP status code 400.
   * @member {number} frontendPortRangeStart The first port number in the range
   * of external ports that will be used to provide inbound access to the
   * backendPort on individual compute nodes. Acceptable values range between 1
   * and 65534 except ports from 50000 to 55000 which are reserved. All ranges
   * within a pool must be distinct and cannot overlap. Each range must contain
   * at least 40 ports. If any reserved or overlapping values are provided the
   * request fails with HTTP status code 400.
   * @member {number} frontendPortRangeEnd The last port number in the range of
   * external ports that will be used to provide inbound access to the
   * backendPort on individual compute nodes. Acceptable values range between 1
   * and 65534 except ports from 50000 to 55000 which are reserved by the Batch
   * service. All ranges within a pool must be distinct and cannot overlap.
   * Each range must contain at least 40 ports. If any reserved or overlapping
   * values are provided the request fails with HTTP status code 400.
   * @member {array} [networkSecurityGroupRules] A list of network security
   * group rules that will be applied to the endpoint. The maximum number of
   * rules that can be specified across all the endpoints on a Batch pool is
   * 25. If no network security group rules are specified, a default rule will
   * be created to allow inbound access to the specified backendPort. If the
   * maximum number of network security group rules is exceeded the request
   * fails with HTTP status code 400.
