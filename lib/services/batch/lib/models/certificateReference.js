/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the CertificateReference class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary A reference to a certificate to be installed on compute nodes in a
 * pool.
 *
 * @member {string} thumbprint The thumbprint of the certificate.
 * 
 * @member {string} thumbprintAlgorithm The algorithm with which the thumbprint
 * is associated. This must be sha1.
 * 
 * @member {string} [storeLocation] The location of the certificate store on
 * the compute node into which to install the certificate. The default value is
 * CurrentUser. This property is applicable only for pools configured with
 * Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux
 * compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task
 * working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is
 * supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with
 * visibility of remoteuser, a certs directory is created in the user's home
 * directory (e.g., /home/<user-name>/certs) where certificates are placed.
 * Possible values include: 'currentuser', 'localmachine', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {string} [storeName] The name of the certificate store on the
 * compute node into which to install the certificate. The default value is My.
 * This property is applicable only for pools configured with Windows nodes
 * (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference).
 * 
 * @member {array} [visibility] Which user accounts on the compute node should
 * have access to the private data of the certificate. The default is all
 * accounts.
