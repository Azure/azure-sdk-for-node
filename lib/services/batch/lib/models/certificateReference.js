  /**
   * Create a CertificateReference.
   * @member {string} thumbprint The thumbprint of the certificate.
   * @member {string} thumbprintAlgorithm The algorithm with which the
   * thumbprint is associated. This must be sha1.
   * @member {string} [storeLocation] The location of the certificate store on
   * the compute node into which to install the certificate. The default value
   * is currentuser. This property is applicable only for pools configured with
   * Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with
   * virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux
   * compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task
   * working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is
   * supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with
   * visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's
   * home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed
   * in that directory. Possible values include: 'currentUser', 'localMachine'
   * @member {string} [storeName] The name of the certificate store on the
   * compute node into which to install the certificate. This property is
   * applicable only for pools configured with Windows nodes (that is, created
   * with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using
   * a Windows image reference). Common store names include: My, Root, CA,
   * Trust, Disallowed, TrustedPeople, TrustedPublisher, AuthRoot, AddressBook,
   * but any custom store name can also be used. The default value is My.
   * @member {array} [visibility] Which user accounts on the compute node
   * should have access to the private data of the certificate. You can specify
   * more than one visibility in this collection. The default is all accounts.
