class TaskConstraints {
  /**
   * Create a TaskConstraints.
   * @property {moment.duration} [maxWallClockTime] The maximum elapsed time
   * that the task may run, measured from the time the task starts. If the task
   * does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it.
   * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may
   * run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [retentionTime] The minimum time to retain the
   * task directory on the compute node where it ran, from the time it
   * completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the
   * task directory and all its contents. The default is infinite, i.e. the
   * task directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or
   * reimaged.
   * @property {number} [maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of times the
   * task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is
   * nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries
   * for the task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will
   * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
   * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
   * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
   * service does not retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum
   * retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
   * Resource files and application packages are only downloaded again if the
   * task is retried on a new compute node.
