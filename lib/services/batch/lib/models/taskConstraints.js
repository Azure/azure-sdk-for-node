/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the TaskConstraints class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Execution constraints to apply to a task.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [maxWallClockTime] The maximum elapsed time that
 * the task may run, measured from the time the task starts. If the task does
 * not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it. If this
 * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * 
 * @member {moment.duration} [retentionTime] The minimum time to retain the
 * task directory on the compute node where it ran, from the time it completes
 * execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the task directory
 * and all its contents. The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will
 * be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * 
 * @member {number} [maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of times the task
 * may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is
 * nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries.
 * The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this
 * limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up
 * to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0,
 * the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1,
 * the Batch service retries the task without limit.
