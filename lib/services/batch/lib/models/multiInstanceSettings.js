class MultiInstanceSettings {
  /**
   * Create a MultiInstanceSettings.
   * @property {number} [numberOfInstances] The number of compute nodes
   * required by the task. If omitted, the default is 1.
   * @property {string} coordinationCommandLine The command line to run on all
   * the compute nodes to enable them to coordinate when the primary runs the
   * main task command. A typical coordination command line launches a
   * background service and verifies that the service is ready to process
   * inter-node messages.
   * @property {array} [commonResourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch
   * service will download before running the coordination command line. The
   * difference between common resource files and task resource files is that
   * common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the
   * primary, whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary.
   * Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the task working
   * directory, but instead are downloaded to the task root directory (one
   * directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the
   * list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will
   * fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
   * occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can
   * be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
