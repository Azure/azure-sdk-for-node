/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the StartTaskInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Information about a start task running on a compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} state The state of the start task on the compute node.
 * running - The start task is currently running. completed - The start task
 * has exited with exit code 0, or the start task has failed and the retry
 * limit has reached, or the start task process did not run due to scheduling
 * errors. Possible values include: 'running', 'completed'
 *
 * @member {date} startTime The time at which the start task started running.
 * This value is reset every time the task is restarted or retried (that is,
 * this is the most recent time at which the start task started running).
 *
 * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the start task stopped running.
 * This is the end time of the most recent run of the start task, if that run
 * has completed (even if that run failed and a retry is pending). This element
 * is not present if the start task is currently running.
 *
 * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the program specified on the
 * start task command line. This property is set only if the start task is in
 * the completed state. In general, the exit code for a process reflects the
 * specific convention implemented by the application developer for that
 * process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be
 * sure that you know the exit code convention used by the application process.
 * However, if the Batch service terminates the start task (due to timeout, or
 * user termination via the API) you may see an operating system-defined exit
 * code.
 *
 * @member {object} [schedulingError] Any error encountered scheduling the
 * start task.
 *
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.category] Possible values include:
 * 'userError', 'serverError', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.code]
 *
 * @member {string} [schedulingError.message]
 *
 * @member {array} [schedulingError.details]
 *
 * @member {number} retryCount The number of times the task has been retried by
 * the Batch service. The task is retried if it exits with a nonzero exit code,
 * up to the specified MaxTaskRetryCount.
 *
 * @member {date} [lastRetryTime] The most recent time at which a retry of the
 * task started running. This element is present only if the task was retried
 * (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is typically the same as
 * startTime, but may be different if the task has been restarted for reasons
 * other than retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted during a
 * retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is not.
