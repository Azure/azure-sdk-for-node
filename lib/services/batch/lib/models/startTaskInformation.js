/**
 * @summary Information about a start task running on a compute node.
  *
 */
class StartTaskInformation {
  /**
   * Create a StartTaskInformation.
   * @member {string} state The state of the start task on the compute node.
   * Possible values include: 'running', 'completed'
   * @member {date} startTime The time at which the start task started running.
   * This value is reset every time the task is restarted or retried (that is,
   * this is the most recent time at which the start task started running).
   * @member {date} [endTime] The time at which the start task stopped running.
   * This is the end time of the most recent run of the start task, if that run
   * has completed (even if that run failed and a retry is pending). This
   * element is not present if the start task is currently running.
   * @member {number} [exitCode] The exit code of the program specified on the
   * start task command line. This property is set only if the start task is in
   * the completed state. In general, the exit code for a process reflects the
   * specific convention implemented by the application developer for that
   * process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be
   * sure that you know the exit code convention used by the application
   * process. However, if the Batch service terminates the start task (due to
   * timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an operating
   * system-defined exit code.
   * @member {object} [containerInfo] Information about the container under
   * which the task is executing. This property is set only if the task runs in
   * a container context.
   * @member {string} [containerInfo.containerId]
   * @member {string} [containerInfo.state] This is the state of the container
   * according to the Docker service. It is equivalent to the status field
   * returned by "docker inspect".
   * @member {string} [containerInfo.error] This is the detailed error string
   * from the Docker service, if available. It is equivalent to the error field
   * returned by "docker inspect".
   * @member {object} [failureInfo] Information describing the task failure, if
   * any. This property is set only if the task is in the completed state and
   * encountered a failure.
   * @member {string} [failureInfo.category] Possible values include:
   * 'userError', 'serverError'
   * @member {string} [failureInfo.code]
   * @member {string} [failureInfo.message]
   * @member {array} [failureInfo.details]
   * @member {number} retryCount The number of times the task has been retried
   * by the Batch service. Task application failures (non-zero exit code) are
   * retried, pre-processing errors (the task could not be run) and file upload
   * errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the task up to the
   * limit specified by the constraints.
   * @member {date} [lastRetryTime] The most recent time at which a retry of
   * the task started running. This element is present only if the task was
   * retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is typically the
   * same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been restarted for
   * reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted
   * during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is
   * not.
   * @member {string} [result] The result of the task execution. If the value
   * is 'failed', then the details of the failure can be found in the
   * failureInfo property. Possible values include: 'success', 'failure'
