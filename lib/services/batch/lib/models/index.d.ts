 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a

 *
 * @member {boolean} [runExclusive] Whether the Job Manager task requires
 * exclusive use of the compute node where it runs. If true, no other tasks
 * will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running.
 * If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a
 * compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's
 * concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple
 * concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
 * packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
 * running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed
 * to a shared directory, not the task directory. Therefore, if a referenced
 * package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not
 * re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a

 * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
 * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.

 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be

 * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
 * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,

 *
 * @member {object} [pool.networkConfiguration]
 *
 * @member {string} [pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network
 * must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The

 * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
 * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
 * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the
 * 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
 * for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from
 * the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes.
 * This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
 * Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the
 * specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the
 * state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property can only be specified
 * for pools created with a cloudServiceConfiguration.
 *
 * @member {object} [pool.startTask]
 *
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run

 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {number} [pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service
 * retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 *
 * @member {array} [pool.certificateReferences] For Windows compute nodes, the
 * Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store
 * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
 * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.

 *
 * @member {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
 * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the Job
 * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any
 * tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks
 * are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
 * affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
 * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user
 * terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
 * creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.
 * The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
 * onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
 * task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it

 * run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If
 * false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute
 * node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent
 * task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent
 * tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute
 * node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on
 * the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
 * installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error. This property is
 * currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying
 * applicationPackageReferences runs on such a pool, it fails with a scheduling
 * error with code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task for jobs

 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
 * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
 * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
 * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If you try to

 * directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does not

 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the Job
 * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job
 * Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
 * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after
 * all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to
 * the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks
 * of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still

 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release task for jobs created
 * under this schedule. The primary purpose of the Job Release task is to undo
 * changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task. Example
 * activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services that were
 * started as part of job preparation. A Job Release task cannot be specified
 * without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the job. The Batch
 * service runs the Job Release task on the compute nodes that have run the Job
 * Preparation task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch
 * service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job
 * can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task

 *
 * @member {array} [commonEnvironmentSettings] A list of common environment
 * variable settings. These environment variables are set for all tasks in jobs
 * created under this schedule (including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and
 * Job Release tasks). Individual tasks can override an environment setting
 * specified here by specifying the same setting name with a different value.
 *
 * @member {object} poolInfo The pool on which the Batch service runs the tasks
 * of jobs created under this schedule.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption] When
 * the pool lifetime scope is jobSchedule level, the Batch service keeps track
 * of the last autopool created for the job schedule, and deletes that pool
 * when the job schedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the
 * user updates the auto pool specification in a way that changes this
 * lifetime. Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 *

 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.imageUris]
 * All the VHDs must be identical and must reside in an Azure Storage account
 * within the same subscription and same region as the Batch account. For best
 * performance, it is recommended that each VHD resides in a separate Azure
 * Storage account. Each VHD can serve upto 20 Windows compute nodes or 40

 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU

 * according to the formula. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and
 * 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or

 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling

 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The
 * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property

 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and

 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In

 * @constructor
 * @summary A job schedule that allows recurring jobs by specifying when to run
 * jobs and a specification used to create each job.
 *
 * @member {string} [id] A string that uniquely identifies the schedule within
 * the account. It is common to use a GUID for the id.
 *
 * @member {string} [displayName] The display name for the schedule.
 *
 * @member {string} [url] The URL of the job schedule.
 *
 * @member {string} [eTag] The ETag of the job schedule. This is an opaque
 * string. You can use it to detect whether the job schedule has changed
 * between requests. In particular, you can be pass the ETag with an Update Job
 * Schedule request to specify that your changes should take effect only if
 * nobody else has modified the schedule in the meantime.
 *
 * @member {date} [lastModified] The last modified time of the job schedule.
 * This is the last time at which the schedule level data, such as the job
 * specification or recurrence information, changed. It does not factor in
 * job-level changes such as new jobs being created or jobs changing state.
 *
 * @member {date} [creationTime] The creation time of the job schedule.
 *
 * @member {string} [state] The current state of the job schedule. Possible
 * values include: 'active', 'completed', 'disabled', 'terminating', 'deleting'
 *
 * @member {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the job schedule
 * entered the current state.
 *
 * @member {string} [previousState] The previous state of the job schedule.
 * This property is not present if the job schedule is in its initial active
 * state. Possible values include: 'active', 'completed', 'disabled',
 * 'terminating', 'deleting'
 *
 * @member {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] The time at which the job
 * schedule entered its previous state. This property is not present if the job
 * schedule is in its initial active state.
 *
 * @member {object} [schedule] The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification] The details of the jobs to be created on
 * this schedule.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noAction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminateJob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noAction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noAction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
 * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The id can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
 * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
 * 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is
 * not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
 * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute
 * node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on
 * the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
 * installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error. This property is
 * currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying
 * applicationPackageReferences runs on such a pool, it fails with a scheduling
 * error with code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files
 * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this
 * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default
 * is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
 * is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
 * service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
 * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
 * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
 * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of
 * the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation
 * task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
 * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a
 * task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in

 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.maxWallClockTime]

 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.commonEnvironmentSettings] Individual
 * tasks can override an environment setting specified here by specifying the
 * same setting name with a different value.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the
 * pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the
 * time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will
 * run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will
 * not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool
 * exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification,
 * but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto
 * pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state,
 * and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property.
 * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive
 * is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption] When
 * the pool lifetime scope is jobSchedule level, the Batch service keeps track
 * of the last autopool created for the job schedule, and deletes that pool
 * when the job schedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the
 * user updates the auto pool specification in a way that changes this
 * lifetime. Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The

 * information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services
 * pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud
 * Services
 * (http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
 * Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall. For

 * PaaS VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually
 * exclusive and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is
 * specified then the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the
 * REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property
 * cannot be specified if the Batch account was created with its
 * poolAllocationMode property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
 * Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2
 * SP1. 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4,
 * equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows

 * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
 * for the specified OS family.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion]
 * This may differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this
 * case some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on
 * the currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
 * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
 * targetOSVersion.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration]
 * This property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure
 * IaaS VMs. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration are mutually exclusive

 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.imageUris]
 * All the VHDs must be identical and must reside in an Azure Storage account
 * within the same subscription and same region as the Batch account. For best
 * performance, it is recommended that each VHD resides in a separate Azure
 * Storage account. Each VHD can serve upto 20 Windows compute nodes or 40
 * Linux compute nodes. You must supply enough VHD URIs to satisfy the
 * 'targetDedicated' property of the pool. If you do not supply enough VHD
 * URIs, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error
 * will occur.

 * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
 * node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
 * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration]
 * This property must not be specified if the imageReference or osDisk property
 * specifies a Linux OS image.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
 * If omitted, the default value is true.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.maxTasksPerNode] The
 * default value is 1. The maximum value of this setting depends on the size of
 * the compute nodes in the pool (the vmSize setting).
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy]
 * How tasks are distributed among compute nodes in the pool.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This
 * timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when
 * enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum
 * value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicated] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to false.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, the targetDedicated element is required. If true, the
 * autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool automatically resizes
 * according to the formula. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval]
 * The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes
 * and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
 * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
 * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property
 * can only be specified for pools created with a cloudServiceConfiguration.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array}

 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope]
 * pool - specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount]
 * The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
 * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
 * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
 * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
 * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
 * not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
 * retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess]
 * If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If
 * the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the
 * Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks
 * to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling
 * error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task
 * to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute
 * node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task
 * fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is
 * false.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences]
 * This property is currently not supported on auto pools created with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch

 * user code.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.metadata] The Batch service does not
 * assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
 *
 * @member {object} [executionInfo] Information about jobs that have been and
 * will be run under this schedule.
 *
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.nextRunTime] This property is meaningful only
 * if the schedule is in the active state when the time comes around. For
 * example, if the schedule is disabled, no job will be created at nextRunTime
 * unless the job is enabled before then.
 *
 * @member {object} [executionInfo.recentJob] This property is present only if

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobScheduleAddParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary A job schedule that allows recurring jobs by specifying when to run
 * jobs and a specification used to create each job.
 *
 * @member {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the schedule within
 * the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
 * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. The id is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may
 * not have two ids within an account that differ only by case).
 *
 * @member {string} [displayName] The display name for the schedule. The
 * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to
 * a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {object} schedule The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {object} jobSpecification The details of the jobs to be created on
 * this schedule.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noAction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminateJob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noAction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noAction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
 * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The id can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
 * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
 * 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is
 * not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
 * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute
 * node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on
 * the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
 * installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error. This property is
 * currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying
 * applicationPackageReferences runs on such a pool, it fails with a scheduling
 * error with code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files

 * is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
 * is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note

 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule

 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a

 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the
 * pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the
 * time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will
 * run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will
 * not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool
 * exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification,
 * but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto
 * pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state,
 * and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property.
 * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive
 * is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption] When
 * the pool lifetime scope is jobSchedule level, the Batch service keeps track
 * of the last autopool created for the job schedule, and deletes that pool
 * when the job schedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the
 * user updates the auto pool specification in a way that changes this
 * lifetime. Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.

 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration]
 * This property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure

 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.imageUris]
 * All the VHDs must be identical and must reside in an Azure Storage account
 * within the same subscription and same region as the Batch account. For best
 * performance, it is recommended that each VHD resides in a separate Azure
 * Storage account. Each VHD can serve upto 20 Windows compute nodes or 40
 * Linux compute nodes. You must supply enough VHD URIs to satisfy the
 * 'targetDedicated' property of the pool. If you do not supply enough VHD
 * URIs, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error
 * will occur.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.caching]
 * none - The caching mode for the disk is not enabled. readOnly - The caching

 * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported

 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
 * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to

 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
 * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property
 * can only be specified for pools created with a cloudServiceConfiguration.

 * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
 * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
 * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
 * not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
 * retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess]
 * If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If
 * the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the
 * Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks
 * to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling
 * error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task
 * to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute
 * node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task
 * fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is
 * false.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a

 * values include: 'active', 'disabling', 'disabled', 'enabling',
 * 'terminating', 'completed', 'deleting'
 *
 * @member {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] The time at which the job
 * entered its previous state. This property is not set if the job is in its
 * initial Active state.
 *
 * @member {number} [priority] The priority of the job. Priority values can
 * range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000
 * being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
 *
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for the job.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the job does not
 * complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any
 * tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be
 * MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time
 * limit on how long the job may run.
 *
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks
 * without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask] Details of a Job Manager task to be
 * launched when the job is started.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.id] The id can contain any combination of

 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not be unique and can
 * contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.

 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
 * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the Job
 * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any
 * tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks
 * are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
 * affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
 * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user
 * terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
 * creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.
 * The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
 * onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
 * task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it
 * is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as

 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no other tasks will
 * run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If
 * false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute
 * node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent
 * task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent
 * tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute
 * node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on
 * the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
 * installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error. This property is
 * currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying
 * applicationPackageReferences runs on such a pool, it fails with a scheduling
 * error with code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task. The Job
 * Preparation task is a special task run on each node before any other task of
 * the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
 * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
 * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
 * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If you try to
 * submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with
 * error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does not
 * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
 * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
 * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
 * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.

 *
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
 * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may
 * run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
 * service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the Job
 * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job
 * Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
 * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after
 * all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to
 * the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks
 * of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still
 * running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue
 * to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs
 * as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release task. The Job Release task
 * is a special task run at the end of the job on each node that has run any
 * other task of the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch
 * service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job
 * can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task
 * with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as

 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {array} [commonEnvironmentSettings] The list of common environment
 * variable settings. These environment variables are set for all tasks in the
 * job (including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and Job Release tasks).
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo] The pool settings associated with the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption] When
 * the pool lifetime scope is jobSchedule level, the Batch service keeps track
 * of the last autopool created for the job schedule, and deletes that pool
 * when the job schedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the
 * user updates the auto pool specification in a way that changes this
 * lifetime. Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The

 *
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
 * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
 * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
 * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot be
 * specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
 * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 *
 * @member {string}

 * the currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
 * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
 * targetOSVersion.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS

 * specified.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.imageUris]
 * All the VHDs must be identical and must reside in an Azure Storage account
 * within the same subscription and same region as the Batch account. For best
 * performance, it is recommended that each VHD resides in a separate Azure
 * Storage account. Each VHD can serve upto 20 Windows compute nodes or 40
 * Linux compute nodes. You must supply enough VHD URIs to satisfy the
 * 'targetDedicated' property of the pool. If you do not supply enough VHD
 * URIs, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error
 * will occur.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.caching]
 * none - The caching mode for the disk is not enabled. readOnly - The caching
 * mode for the disk is read only. readWrite - The caching mode for the disk is
 * read and write. The default value for caching is none. For information about

 * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported

 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and
 * 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling
 * inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The
 * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property

 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
 * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 *
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences] This
 * property is currently not supported on auto pools created with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property.
 *
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
 *
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch
 * service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of
 * user code.
 *
 * @member {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should
 * take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. noAction - do
 * nothing. The job remains active unless terminated or disabled by some other
 * means. terminateJob - terminate the job. The job's terminateReason is set to
 * 'AllTasksComplete'. The default is noAction. Possible values include:
 * 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 *
 * @member {string} [onTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should take
 * when any task in the job fails. A task is considered to have failed if it
 * completes with a non-zero exit code and has exhausted its retry count, or if
 * it had a scheduling error. noAction - do nothing.
 * performExitOptionsJobAction - take the action associated with the task exit
 * condition in the task's exitConditions collection. (This may still result in
 * no action being taken, if that is what the task specifies.) The default is
 * noAction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 *
 * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata;
 * it is solely for the use of user code.
 *
 * @member {object} [executionInfo] The execution information for the job.
 *
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.startTime] This is the time at which the job
 * was created.
 *
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.endTime] This property is set only if the job
 * is in the completed state.
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.poolId] This element contains the actual
 * pool where the job is assigned. When you get job details from the service,
 * they also contain a poolInfo element, which contains the pool configuration
 * data from when the job was added or updated. That poolInfo element may also
 * contain a poolId element. If it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does
 * not, it means the job ran on an auto pool, and this property contains the id
 * of that auto pool.
 *
 * @member {object} [executionInfo.schedulingError] This property is not set if
 * there was no error starting the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.category] Possible values
 * include: 'userError', 'serverError', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.code]
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.message]
 *
 * @member {array} [executionInfo.schedulingError.details]
 *
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.terminateReason] This property is set only
 * if the job is in the completed state. If the Batch service terminates the
 * job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete - the Job Manager task
 * completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry -
 * the job reached its maxWallClockTime constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the
 * job ran as part of a schedule, and the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete
 * - the job's onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminateJob, and all
 * tasks in the job are complete. TaskFailed - the job's onTaskFailure
 * attribute is set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a task in the job
 * failed with an exit condition that specified a jobAction of terminateJob.
 * Any other string is a user-defined reason specified in a call to the
 * 'Terminate a job' operation.
 *
 * @member {object} [stats] Resource usage statistics for the entire lifetime
 * of the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [stats.url]
 *
 * @member {date} [stats.startTime]
 *
 * @member {date} [stats.lastUpdateTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.userCPUTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.kernelCPUTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.wallClockTime]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOps]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOps]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOGiB]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOGiB]
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.numSucceededTasks] A task completes successfully if
 * it returns exit code 0.
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.numFailedTasks] A task fails if it exhausts its
 * maximum retry count without returning exit code 0.
 *
 * @member {number} [stats.numTaskRetries]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.waitTime] The wait time for a task is
 * defined as the elapsed time between the creation of the task and the start
 * of task execution. (If the task is retried due to failures, the wait time is
 * the time to the most recent task execution.) This value is only reported in
 * the account lifetime statistics; it is not included in the job statistics.

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobAddParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary An Azure Batch job to add.
 *
 * @member {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the job within the
 * account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
 * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. It is common to use a GUID for the id.
 *
 * @member {string} [displayName] The display name for the job. The display
 * name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a
 * maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {number} [priority] The priority of the job. Priority values can
 * range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000
 * being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
 *
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for the job.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the job does not
 * complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any
 * tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be
 * MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time
 * limit on how long the job may run.
 *
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks
 * without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask] Details of a Job Manager task to be
 * launched when the job is started. If the job does not specify a Job Manager
 * task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job. If the job does specify
 * a Job Manager task, the Batch service creates the Job Manager task when the
 * job is created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager task before
 * scheduling other tasks in the job. The Job Manager task's typical purpose is
 * to control and/or monitor job execution, for example by deciding what
 * additional tasks to run, determining when the work is complete, etc.
 * (However, a Job Manager task is not restricted to these activities - it is a
 * fully-fledged task in the system and perform whatever actions are required
 * for the job.) For example, a Job Manager task might download a file
 * specified as a parameter, analyze the contents of that file and submit
 * additional tasks based on those contents.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.id] The id can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not be unique and can
 * contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
 * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the Job
 * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any
 * tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks
 * are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
 * affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
 * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user
 * terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
 * creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.
 * The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
 * onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
 * task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it
 * is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as
 * a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no other tasks will
 * run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If
 * false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute
 * node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent
 * task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent
 * tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute
 * node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on
 * the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
 * installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error. This property is
 * currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying
 * applicationPackageReferences runs on such a pool, it fails with a scheduling
 * error with code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task. If a job has
 * a Job Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task
 * on a compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute
 * node.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
 * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
 * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
 * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If you try to
 * submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with
 * error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does not
 * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
 * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
 * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
 * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
 * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may
 * run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
 * service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the Job
 * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job
 * Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
 * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after
 * all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to
 * the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks
 * of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still
 * running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue
 * to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs
 * as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release task. A Job Release task
 * cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the
 * job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute nodes that
 * have run the Job Preparation task. The primary purpose of the Job Release
 * task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task.
 * Example activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services
 * that were started as part of job preparation.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch
 * service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job
 * can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task
 * with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobReleaseTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobReleaseTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.maxWallClockTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as
 * a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {array} [commonEnvironmentSettings] The list of common environment
 * variable settings. These environment variables are set for all tasks in the
 * job (including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and Job Release tasks).
 *
 * @member {object} poolInfo The pool on which the Batch service runs the job's
 * tasks.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption] When
 * the pool lifetime scope is jobSchedule level, the Batch service keeps track
 * of the last autopool created for the job schedule, and deletes that pool
 * when the job schedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the
 * user updates the auto pool specification in a way that changes this
 * lifetime. Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The
 * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to
 * a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.vmSize] For
 * information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services
 * pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud
 * Services
 * (http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
 * Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall. For
 * information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the Virtual
 * Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see
 * Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux)
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/)
 * or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows)
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/).
 * Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium
 * storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
 * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
 * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
 * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot be
 * specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
 * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
 * Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2
 * SP1. 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4,
 * equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows
 * Server 2016. For more information, see Azure Guest OS Releases
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.targetOSVersion]
 * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
 * for the specified OS family.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion]
 * This may differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this
 * case some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on
 * the currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
 * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
 * targetOSVersion.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS
 * VMs. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration are mutually exclusive and
 * one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then the
 * Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly,
 * the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference]
 * This property and osDisk are mutually exclusive and one of the properties
 * must be specified.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.publisher]
 * For example, Canonical or MicrosoftWindowsServer.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.offer]
 * For example, UbuntuServer or WindowsServer.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.sku]
 * For example, 14.04.0-LTS or 2012-R2-Datacenter.
 *
 * @member {string}

 * specified.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.imageUris]
 * All the VHDs must be identical and must reside in an Azure Storage account
 * within the same subscription and same region as the Batch account. For best
 * performance, it is recommended that each VHD resides in a separate Azure
 * Storage account. Each VHD can serve upto 20 Windows compute nodes or 40
 * Linux compute nodes. You must supply enough VHD URIs to satisfy the
 * 'targetDedicated' property of the pool. If you do not supply enough VHD
 * URIs, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error
 * will occur.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.caching]
 * none - The caching mode for the disk is not enabled. readOnly - The caching
 * mode for the disk is read only. readWrite - The caching mode for the disk is

 * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
 * node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
 * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
 *
 * @member {object}

 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
 * If omitted, the default value is true.
 *
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.maxTasksPerNode] The
 * default value is 1. The maximum value of this setting depends on the size of
 * the compute nodes in the pool (the vmSize setting).
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy]
 * How tasks are distributed among compute nodes in the pool.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies
 * only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to
 * true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If
 * you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
 * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicated] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to false.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, the targetDedicated element is required. If true, the
 * autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool automatically resizes
 * according to the formula. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and
 * 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling
 * inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The
 * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property
 * can only be specified for pools created with a cloudServiceConfiguration.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array}

 *
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.environmentSettings]
 *

 * task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *

 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope]
 * pool - specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch
 * service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
 * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 *
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences] This
 * property is currently not supported on auto pools created with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property.
 *
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
 *
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch
 * service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of
 * user code.
 *
 * @member {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should
 * take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. Note that if a
 * job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option
 * is therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noAction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminateJob once you have finished adding tasks.
 * Permitted values are: noAction - do nothing. The job remains active unless
 * terminated or disabled by some other means. terminateJob - terminate the
 * job. The job's terminateReason is set to 'AllTasksComplete'. The default is
 * noAction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 *
 * @member {string} [onTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should take
 * when any task in the job fails. A task is considered to have failed if it
 * completes with a non-zero exit code and has exhausted its retry count, or if
 * it had a scheduling error. noAction - do nothing.
 * performExitOptionsJobAction - take the action associated with the task exit
 * condition in the task's exitConditions collection. (This may still result in
 * no action being taken, if that is what the task specifies.) The default is
 * noAction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 *
 * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata;
 * it is solely for the use of user code.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [usesTaskDependencies] The flag that determines if this
 * job will use tasks with dependencies.

 * pool.
 *
 * @member {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network must be
 * in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
 * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the
 * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
 * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
 * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the
 * 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
 * for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from
 * the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes.
 * This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
 * Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the
 * specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the
 * state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property can only be specified
 * for pools created with a cloudServiceConfiguration.
 *
 * @member {object} [startTask] A task specified to run on each compute node as
 * it joins the pool.
 *
 * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run under
 * a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as

 * user is a user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator
 * permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include:
 * 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 *
 * @member {array} [certificateReferences] The list of certificates to be
 * installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the
 * Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store
 * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
 * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] The list of application
 * packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
 *
 * @member {number} [maxTasksPerNode] The maximum number of tasks that can run

 * the node or task.
 *
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints that apply to this
 * task. If you do not specify constraints, the maxTaskRetryCount is the
 * maxTaskRetryCount specified for the job, and the maxWallClockTime and
 * retentionTime are infinite.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 *
 * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the task runs.
 * If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool - specifies that the
 * task runs as the common auto user account which is created on every node in
 * a pool. task - specifies that the service should create a new user for the
 * task. The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin - The auto
 * user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The auto user is a
 * user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator permissions.
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {object} [multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that the
 * task is a multi-instance task, and contains information about how to run the
 * multi-instance task.
 *
 * @member {number} [multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances]
 *
 * @member {string} [multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine] A typical
 * coordination command line launches a background service and verifies that
 * the service is ready to process inter-node messages.
 *
 * @member {array} [multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] The difference
 * between common resource files and task resource files is that common
 * resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary,
 * whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary.
 *
 * @member {object} [dependsOn] The tasks that this task depends on. This task
 * will not be scheduled until all tasks that it depends on have completed
 * successfully. If any of those tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts,
 * this task will never be scheduled. If the job does not have
 * usesTaskDependencies set to true, and this element is present, the request
 * fails with error code TaskDependenciesNotSpecifiedOnJob.
 *

 *
 * @member {array} [dependsOn.taskIdRanges]
 *
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
 * packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
 * running the command line.
 *
 * @member {object} [authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
 * authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service
 * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task
 * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
 * operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
 * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
 * that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
 * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
 * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array} [authenticationTokenSettings.access] The authentication
 * token grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently
 * the only supported value for the access property is 'job', which grants
 * access to all operations related to the job which contains the task.

 * @summary The set of changes to be made to a job schedule.
 *
 * @member {object} [schedule] The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created. If you do not specify this element, the existing schedule is left
 * unchanged.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification] The details of the jobs to be created on
 * this schedule. Updates affect only jobs that are started after the update
 * has taken place. Any currently active job continues with the older
 * specification.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noAction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminateJob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noAction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noAction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
 * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The id can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
 * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
 * 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux.
 *

 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is
 * not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
 * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should

 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute
 * node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on
 * the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
 * installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error. This property is
 * currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying
 * applicationPackageReferences runs on such a pool, it fails with a scheduling
 * error with code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files
 * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this
 * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default
 * is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
 * is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
 * service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
 * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
 * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
 * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of
 * the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation
 * task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
 * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a
 * task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in

 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName] The

 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is

 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full

 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.commonEnvironmentSettings] Individual
 * tasks can override an environment setting specified here by specifying the
 * same setting name with a different value.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the
 * pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the
 * time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will
 * run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will
 * not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool
 * exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification,
 * but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto
 * pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state,
 * and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property.
 * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive
 * is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption] When
 * the pool lifetime scope is jobSchedule level, the Batch service keeps track
 * of the last autopool created for the job schedule, and deletes that pool
 * when the job schedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the
 * user updates the auto pool specification in a way that changes this
 * lifetime. Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
 *
 * @member {string}

 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration]
 * This property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure

 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
 * node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
 * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.

 * specifies a Linux OS image.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
 * If omitted, the default value is true.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.maxTasksPerNode] The

 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This
 * timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when
 * enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum
 * value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicated] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to false.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, the targetDedicated element is required. If true, the
 * autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool automatically resizes
 * according to the formula. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval]
 * The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes
 * and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
 * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
 * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. This property
 * can only be specified for pools created with a cloudServiceConfiguration.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c

 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount]
 * The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
 * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
 * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
 * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
 * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
 * not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
 * retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess]
 * If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If
 * the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the
 * Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks
 * to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling
 * error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task
 * to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute
 * node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task
 * fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is
 * false.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobScheduleUpdateParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary The set of changes to be made to a job schedule.
 *
 * @member {object} schedule The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created. If you do not specify this element, it is equivalent to passing the
 * default schedule: that is, a single job scheduled to run immediately.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 *
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 *
 * @member {object} jobSpecification Details of the jobs to be created on this
 * schedule. Updates affect only jobs that are started after the update has
 * taken place. Any currently active job continues with the older
 * specification.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noAction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminateJob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noAction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noAction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 *
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
 * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The id can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
 * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
 * 1024.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is
 * not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if
 * the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute
 * node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on
 * the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
 * installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error. This property is
 * currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying
 * applicationPackageReferences runs on such a pool, it fails with a scheduling
 * error with code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.
 *
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 *
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files
 * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this
 * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default
 * is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
 * is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
 * service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries the task without limit.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
 * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
 * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
 * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of
 * the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation
 * task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
 * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
 * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a
 * task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux.

 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.maxWallClockTime]
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.retentionTime]
 * The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool -
 * specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is
 * created on every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should
 * create a new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values
 * include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * nonAdmin - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin -
 * The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full

 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.commonEnvironmentSettings] Individual
 * tasks can override an environment setting specified here by specifying the
 * same setting name with a different value.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the
 * pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the
 * time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will
 * run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will
 * not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool
 * exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification,
 * but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto
 * pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state,
 * and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property.
 * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive
 * is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.

 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the

 * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 *
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and

 * @constructor
 * @summary The set of changes to be made to a job.
 *
 * @member {number} [priority] The priority of the job. Priority values can
 * range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000
 * being the highest priority. If omitted, it is set to the default value 0.
 *
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for the job. If
 * omitted, the constraints are cleared.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the job does not
 * complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any

 * MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time
 * limit on how long the job may run.
 *
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks
 * without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 *
 * @member {object} poolInfo The pool on which the Batch service runs the job's

 * poolInfo, only the keepAlive property can be updated, and then only if the
 * auto pool has a poolLifetimeOption of job.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption] When
 * the pool lifetime scope is jobSchedule level, the Batch service keeps track
 * of the last autopool created for the job schedule, and deletes that pool
 * when the job schedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the
 * user updates the auto pool specification in a way that changes this
 * lifetime. Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the

 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
