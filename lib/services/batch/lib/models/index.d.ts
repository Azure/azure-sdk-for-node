 * long as possible (that is, Compute Nodes running 'normal' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes
 * running Job Manager Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system

 * make room for the Job Manager Task to restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not
 * have priority over Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are observed. For
 * example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will not displace Tasks
 * of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
 * Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is
 * rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations
 * are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
 * maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of
 * this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
 * restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running
