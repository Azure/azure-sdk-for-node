 * explicitly terminate it.
 * @member {moment.duration} [startWindow] The time interval, starting from the

 * Request).
 * @member {moment.duration} [recurrenceInterval] The time interval between the

 * can have at most one active job under it at any given time. Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobManagerTask class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Specifies details of a Job Manager task.
 *
 * The Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The
 * Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other tasks
 * in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve
 * compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible
 * (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running Job
 * Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the
 * system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle
 * nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the
 * pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager
 * task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have
 * priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities
 * are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be
 * restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job. Batch will retry
 * tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of
 * recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
 * compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure.
 * Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
 * against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an
 * internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all
 * tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.
 *
 * @member {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task
 * within the job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric
 * characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters.
 * @member {string} [displayName] The display name of the Job Manager task. It
 * need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum
 * length of 1024.
 * @member {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Manager task. The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container under
 * which the Job Manager task runs. If the pool that will run this task has
 * containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If the pool that will
 * run this task doesn't have containerConfiguration set, this must not be set.
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
 * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
 * mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into
 * the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These additional
 * options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command, in
 * addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full image
 * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided as
 * part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be omitted if

 * download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory. There is a
 * maximum size for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the
 * task cannot be added and the response error code will be
 * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs the recommended solution is to use an
 * ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * upload from the compute node after running the command line. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node
 * on which the primary task is executed.
 * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the Job Manager task.
 * @member {object} [constraints] Constraints that apply to the Job Manager
 * task.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to a
 * nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then
 * retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch
 * tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum
 * retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after the first
 * attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit. Resource files and application packages are only
 * downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute node.
 * @member {boolean} [killJobOnCompletion] Whether completion of the Job
 * Manager task signifies completion of the entire job. If true, when the Job
 * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any
 * tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks
 * are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
 * affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
 * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user
 * terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
 * creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.
 * The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
 * onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
 * task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it
 * is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the Job
 * Manager task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user
 * unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is task.
 * Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default value is
 * nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [runExclusive] Whether the Job Manager task requires
 * exclusive use of the compute node where it runs. If true, no other tasks
 * will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running.
 * If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a
 * compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's
 * concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple
 * concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
 * packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
 * running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed
 * to a shared directory, not the task working directory. Therefore, if a
 * referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then
 * it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a
 * referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the
 * package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object} [authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
 * authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service
 * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task
 * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
 * operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
 * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
 * that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
 * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
 * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array} [authenticationTokenSettings.access] The authentication
 * token grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently
 * the only supported value for the access property is 'job', which grants
 * access to all operations related to the job which contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [allowLowPriorityNode] Whether the Job Manager task may
 * run on a low-priority compute node. The default value is true.

 * @constructor
 * @summary A Job Preparation task to run before any tasks of the job on any

 *
 * You can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the

 * common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job Preparation
 * task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the
 * compute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting a local service
 * on the compute node so that all tasks of that job can communicate with it.
 * If the Job Preparation task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before
 * exiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run tasks of this job on the
 * compute node. The node remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it
 * is reimaged. The node remains active and can be used for other jobs. The Job
 * Preparation task can run multiple times on the same compute node. Therefore,
 * you should write the Job Preparation task to handle re-execution. If the
 * compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is run again on the node
 * before scheduling any other task of the job, if
 * rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task did not
 * previously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job Preparation
 * task is run again before scheduling any task of the job. Batch will retry
 * tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of
 * recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy

 * the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} commandLine The command line of the Job Preparation task.
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the

 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to a
 * nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then
 * retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch
 * tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum
 * retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after the first
 * attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit. Resource files and application packages are only
 * downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute node.
 * @member {boolean} [waitForSuccess] Whether the Batch service should wait for
 * the Job Preparation task to complete successfully before scheduling any
 * other tasks of the job on the compute node. A Job Preparation task has
 * completed successfully if it exits with exit code 0. If true and the Job
 * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job
 * Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
 * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after
 * all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to
 * the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks
 * of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still
 * running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue
 * to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the Job
 * Preparation task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative
 * user unique to the task on Windows nodes, or a a non-administrative user
 * unique to the pool on Linux nodes.
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser

 * @member {boolean} [rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] Whether the Batch service
 * should rerun the Job Preparation task after a compute node reboots. The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job

 * a compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the job ends
 * without any further tasks of the job running on that compute node (and hence
 * the Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release task does
 * not run on that node. If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task
 * is still running, the Job Release task runs again when the compute node
 * starts up. The job is not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks

 * @member {boolean} [enableInterNodeCommunication] Whether the pool permits
 * direct communication between nodes. Enabling inter-node communication limits
 * the maximum size of the pool due to deployment restrictions on the nodes of
 * the pool. This may result in the pool not reaching its desired size. The
 * default value is false.
 * @member {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for the
 * pool.
 * @member {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network must be
 * in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
 * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the

 * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
 * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the
 * 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
 * for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from
 * the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes.
 * This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
 * Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the
 * specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the
 * state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool endpoint
 * configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [startTask] A task to run on each compute node as it joins
 * the pool. The task runs when the node is added to the pool or when the node
 * is restarted.
 * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run under
 * a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified, all
 * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure
 * Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
 * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command,
 * in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the full
 * image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
 * omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If
 * omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this element
 * are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
 * non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value
 * is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [certificateReferences] A list of certificates to be
 * installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the
 * Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store
 * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
 * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] The list of application
 * packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
 * @member {array} [applicationLicenses] The list of application licenses the
 * Batch service will make available on each compute node in the pool. The list
 * of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
 * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool
 * creation will fail.
 * @member {array} [userAccounts] The list of user accounts to be created on
 * each node in the pool.
 * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata;
 * it is solely for the use of user code.

 * @member {string} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId] The Batch
 * node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the
 * command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service. There
 * are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for
 * different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches
 * the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs
 * along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported

 * @member {boolean}
 * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
 * If omitted, the default value is true.
 * @member {array} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks] This property
 * must be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data
 * disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node gets its own disk
 * (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be attached, each
 * attached disk is empty. When the node is removed from the pool, the disk and
 * all data associated with it is also deleted. The disk is not formatted after
 * being attached, it must be formatted before use - for more information see

 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-disk-ps#add-an-empty-data-disk-to-a-virtual-machine.
 * @member {string} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType] This only
 * applies to images that contain the Windows operating system, and should only
 * be used when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes which will be
 * deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is applied. Values
 * are:
 *
 * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
 * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
 * @member {object} [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration]
 * If specified, setup is performed on each node in the pool to allow tasks to
 * run in containers. All regular tasks and job manager tasks run on this pool
 * must specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may specify
 * it.
 * @member {array}
 * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". An
 * image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image is
 * fully qualified with an alternative registry.
 * @member {array}
 * [pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries]
 * If any images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
 * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
 * @member {number} [pool.maxTasksPerNode] The default value is 1. The maximum
 * value of this setting depends on the size of the compute nodes in the pool
 * (the vmSize setting).
 * @member {object} [pool.taskSchedulingPolicy]
 * @member {string} [pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] Possible values
 * include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration} [pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies only to
 * manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify
 * a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400
 * (Bad Request).
 * @member {number} [pool.targetDedicatedNodes] This property must not be
 * specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to
 * false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
 * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {number} [pool.targetLowPriorityNodes] This property must not be
 * specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to
 * false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
 * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {boolean} [pool.enableAutoScale] If false, at least one of
 * targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must be specified. If true,
 * the autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool automatically resizes
 * according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string} [pool.autoScaleFormula] This property must not be specified
 * if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is required if enableAutoScale is set
 * to true. The formula is checked for validity before the pool is created. If
 * the formula is not valid, the Batch service rejects the request with
 * detailed error information.
 * @member {moment.duration} [pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The default
 * value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and 168
 * hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or greater
 * than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an invalid
 * property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
 * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {boolean} [pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling inter-node
 * communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to deployment
 * restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the pool not
 * reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 * @member {object} [pool.networkConfiguration]
 * @member {string} [pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network
 * must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
 * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the
 * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
 * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
 * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the
 * 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
 * for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from
 * the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes.
 * This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
 * Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the
 * specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the
 * state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object} [pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool
 * endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array}
 * [pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools] The
 * maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [pool.startTask]
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [pool.startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified,
 * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
 * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
 * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
 * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]

 * element are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [pool.startTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [pool.startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as
 * a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number} [pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service
 * retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 * @member {boolean} [pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [pool.certificateReferences] For Windows compute nodes, the
 * Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store
 * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
 * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array} [pool.applicationPackageReferences]
 * @member {array} [pool.applicationLicenses] The list of application licenses
 * must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses. If a
 * license is requested which is not supported, pool creation will fail.
 * @member {array} [pool.userAccounts]
 * @member {array} [pool.metadata] The Batch service does not assign any
 * meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the PoolInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Specifies how a job should be assigned to a pool.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolId] The ID of an existing pool. All the tasks of the
 * job will run on the specified pool. You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 * @member {object} [autoPoolSpecification] Characteristics for a temporary
 * 'auto pool'. The Batch service will create this auto pool when the job is
 * submitted. If auto pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a
 * completed state, and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling
 * error property. The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and,
 * unless keepAlive is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions
 * that affect the lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will
 * result in unexpected behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the
 * auto pool specification, but not both.
 * @member {string} [autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch service
 * assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To distinguish
 * between pools created for different purposes, you can specify this element

 * [autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName
 * and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string}
 * [autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
 * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number} [autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount]
 * The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
 * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
 * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
 * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
 * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
 * not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
 * retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean} [autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries
 * the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the
 * task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch
 * service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it.
 * This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details.
 * If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences] For
 * Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the
 * specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array} [autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences]
 * @member {array} [autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationLicenses] The list of
 * application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application
 * licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool creation
 * will fail.
 * @member {array} [autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
 * @member {array} [autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch service does
 * not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobSpecification class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary Specifies details of the jobs to be created on a schedule.
 *
 * @member {number} [priority] The priority of jobs created under this
 * schedule. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the
 * lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
 * This priority is used as the default for all jobs under the job schedule.
 * You can update a job's priority after it has been created using by using the
 * update job API.
 * @member {string} [displayName] The display name for jobs created under this
 * schedule. The name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters
 * up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {boolean} [usesTaskDependencies] Whether tasks in the job can define
 * dependencies on each other. The default is false.
 * @member {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should
 * take when all tasks in a job created under this schedule are in the
 * completed state. Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all tasks are
 * considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a Job
 * Manager task; if you want to use automatic job termination without a Job
 * Manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update
 * the job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have
 * finished adding tasks. The default is noaction. Possible values include:
 * 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 * @member {string} [onTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should take
 * when any task fails in a job created under this schedule. A task is
 * considered to have failed if it have failed if has a failureInfo. A
 * failureInfo is set if the task completes with a non-zero exit code after
 * exhausting its retry count, or if there was an error starting the task, for
 * example due to a resource file download error. The default is noaction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for jobs created
 * under this schedule.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the job does not
 * complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any
 * tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be
 * MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time
 * limit on how long the job may run.
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks
 * without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask] The details of a Job Manager task to be
 * launched when a job is started under this schedule. If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not be unique and can
 * contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If the pool that will
 * run this task has containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If
 * the pool that will run this task doesn't have containerConfiguration set,
 * this must not be set. When this is specified, all directories recursively
 * below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the
 * node) are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are
 * mapped into the container, and the task command line is executed in the
 * container.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
 * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
 * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory. There is a maximum size
 * for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the task cannot be
 * added and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
 * occurs the recommended solution is to use an ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For multi-instance tasks, the
 * files will only be uploaded from the compute node on which the primary task
 * is executed.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the Job
 * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any
 * tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks
 * are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
 * affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
 * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user
 * terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
 * creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.
 * The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
 * onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
 * task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it
 * is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as
 * a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no other tasks will
 * run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If
 * false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute
 * node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent
 * task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent
 * tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
 * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
 * copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot
 * be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The default value is
 * true.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task for jobs
 * created under this schedule. If a job has a Job Preparation task, the Batch
 * service will run the Job Preparation task on a compute node before starting
 * any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
 * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
 * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
 * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If you try to
 * submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with
 * error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does not
 * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
 * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
 * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
 * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If
 * the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path
 * (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided
 * environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings] When this is
 * specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the
 * root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container,
 * all task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
 * command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
 * the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag
 * is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
 * default.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry] This
 * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
 * the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
 * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may
 * run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the Job
 * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job
 * Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
 * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after
 * all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to
 * the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks
 * of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still
 * running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue
 * to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs
 * as a non-administrative user unique to the task on Windows nodes, or a a
 * non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux nodes.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
 * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release task for jobs created
 * under this schedule. The primary purpose of the Job Release task is to undo
 * changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task. Example
 * activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services that were
 * started as part of job preparation. A Job Release task cannot be specified
 * without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the job. The Batch
 * service runs the Job Release task on the compute nodes that have run the Job
 * Preparation task.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch
 * service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job
 * can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task
 * with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the

 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings] When this is specified,
 * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
 * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
 * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
 * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobReleaseTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this

 * @member {array} [jobReleaseTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.maxWallClockTime]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobReleaseTask.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as
 * a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {array} [commonEnvironmentSettings] A list of common environment
 * variable settings. These environment variables are set for all tasks in jobs
 * created under this schedule (including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and
 * Job Release tasks). Individual tasks can override an environment setting
 * specified here by specifying the same setting name with a different value.
 * @member {object} poolInfo The pool on which the Batch service runs the tasks
 * of jobs created under this schedule.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
 * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The
 * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to
 * a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.vmSize] For
 * information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services
 * pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud
 * Services
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
 * Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and A2V2.
 * For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the
 * Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux)
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/)
 * or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows)
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/).
 * Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium
 * storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
 * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
 * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
 * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot be
 * specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
 * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
 * Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2
 * SP1. 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4,
 * equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows
 * Server 2016. For more information, see Azure Guest OS Releases
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.targetOSVersion]
 * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
 * for the specified OS family.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion]
 * This may differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this
 * case some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on
 * the currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
 * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
 * targetOSVersion.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS
 * VMs. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration are mutually exclusive and
 * one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then the
 * Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly,
 * the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference]
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.publisher]
 * For example, Canonical or MicrosoftWindowsServer.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.offer]
 * For example, UbuntuServer or WindowsServer.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.sku]
 * For example, 14.04.0-LTS or 2012-R2-Datacenter.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.version]
 * A value of 'latest' can be specified to select the latest version of an

 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
 * node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
 * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration]

 * If omitted, the default value is true.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks]
 * This property must be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to
 * have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node
 * gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be
 * attached, each attached disk is empty. When the node is removed from the
 * pool, the disk and all data associated with it is also deleted. The disk is
 * not formatted after being attached, it must be formatted before use - for
 * more information see

 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies
 * only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to
 * true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If
 * you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
 * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes]
 * This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
 * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either
 * targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetLowPriorityNodes] This property
 * must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale
 * is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
 * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, at least one of targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must
 * be specified. If true, the autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool
 * automatically resizes according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and
 * 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling
 * inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The
 * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration]
 * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object}

 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch
 * service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
 * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences]
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationLicenses]
 * The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service

 * @member {date} [creationTime] The creation time of the job schedule.
 * @member {string} [state] The current state of the job schedule. Possible
 * values include: 'active', 'completed', 'disabled', 'terminating', 'deleting'
 * @member {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the job schedule
 * entered the current state.
 * @member {string} [previousState] The previous state of the job schedule.
 * This property is not present if the job schedule is in its initial active
 * state. Possible values include: 'active', 'completed', 'disabled',
 * 'terminating', 'deleting'
 * @member {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] The time at which the job
 * schedule entered its previous state. This property is not present if the job
 * schedule is in its initial active state.
 * @member {object} [schedule] The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification] The details of the jobs to be created on
 * this schedule.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noaction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,

 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not

 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task

 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
 * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
 * copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot
 * be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The
 * default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings]
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the

 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this
 * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default
 * is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
 * is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
 * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
 * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
 * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of
 * the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation
 * task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
 * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task on
 * Windows nodes, or a a non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux
 * nodes.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName]

 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a
 * task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in

 * same setting name with a different value.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo]
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the
 * pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the
 * time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will
 * run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will
 * not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool
 * exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification,
 * but not both.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto
 * pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state,
 * and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property.
 * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive
 * is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
 * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'

 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This
 * timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when
 * enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum

 * service rejects the request with an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes]

 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
 * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for

 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount]
 * The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
 * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
 * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
 * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
 * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
 * not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
 * retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess]
 * If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If
 * the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the
 * Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks
 * to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info
 * details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to
 * complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node
 * while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new
 * tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobScheduleAddParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary A job schedule that allows recurring jobs by specifying when to run
 * jobs and a specification used to create each job.
 *
 * @member {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the schedule within
 * the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
 * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may
 * not have two IDs within an account that differ only by case).
 * @member {string} [displayName] The display name for the schedule. The
 * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to
 * a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {object} schedule The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {object} jobSpecification The details of the jobs to be created on
 * this schedule.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noaction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
 * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
 * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
 * 1024.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative
 * path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided
 * environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If the
 * pool that will run this task has containerConfiguration set, this must be
 * set as well. If the pool that will run this task doesn't have
 * containerConfiguration set, this must not be set. When this is specified,
 * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
 * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
 * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
 * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory. There is a
 * maximum size for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the
 * task cannot be added and the response error code will be
 * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs the recommended solution is to use an
 * ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For
 * multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node
 * on which the primary task is executed.
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is
 * not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
 * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
 * copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot
 * be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The
 * default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings]
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
 * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
 * mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into
 * the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
 * the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag
 * is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
 * default.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry] This
 * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files
 * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this
 * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default
 * is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
 * is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
 * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
 * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
 * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of
 * the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation
 * task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
 * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task on
 * Windows nodes, or a a non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux
 * nodes.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
 * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a
 * task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in

 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings] When
 * this is specified, all directories recursively below the
 * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
 * mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into
 * the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}

 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks]
 * This property must be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to
 * have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node
 * gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be
 * attached, each attached disk is empty. When the node is removed from the

 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This
 * timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when
 * enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum
 * value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes]

 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, at least one of targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must
 * be specified. If true, the autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool
 * automatically resizes according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is

 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval]
 * The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes
 * and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
 * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the

 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
 * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object}

 * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum

 * code 400.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings]
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the

 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount]
 * The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
 * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
 * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
 * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
 * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
 * not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
 * retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess]
 * If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If
 * the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the
 * Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks
 * to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info
 * details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to
 * complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node
 * while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new
 * tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,

 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks
 * without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask] Details of a Job Manager task to be
 * launched when the job is started.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not be unique and can
 * contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If the pool that will
 * run this task has containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If
 * the pool that will run this task doesn't have containerConfiguration set,
 * this must not be set. When this is specified, all directories recursively
 * below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the
 * node) are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are
 * mapped into the container, and the task command line is executed in the
 * container.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
 * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
 * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory. There is a maximum size
 * for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the task cannot be
 * added and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
 * occurs the recommended solution is to use an ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For multi-instance tasks, the
 * files will only be uploaded from the compute node on which the primary task
 * is executed.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the Job
 * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any
 * tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks
 * are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
 * affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
 * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user
 * terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
 * creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.
 * The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
 * onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
 * task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it
 * is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as
 * a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no other tasks will
 * run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If
 * false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute
 * node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent
 * task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent
 * tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
 * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
 * copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot
 * be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The default value is
 * true.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task. The Job
 * Preparation task is a special task run on each node before any other task of
 * the job.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
 * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
 * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
 * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If you try to
 * submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with
 * error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does not
 * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
 * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
 * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
 * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If

 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this

 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
 * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may
 * run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task

 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the Job
 * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job
 * Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
 * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after
 * all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to
 * the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks
 * of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still
 * running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue
 * to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs
 * as a non-administrative user unique to the task on Windows nodes, or a a
 * non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux nodes.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
 * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release task. The Job Release task
 * is a special task run at the end of the job on each node that has run any
 * other task of the job.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch
 * service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job
 * can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task
 * with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the

 * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the

 * @member {array} [commonEnvironmentSettings] The list of common environment
 * variable settings. These environment variables are set for all tasks in the
 * job (including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and Job Release tasks).
 * Individual tasks can override an environment setting specified here by
 * specifying the same setting name with a different value.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo] The pool settings associated with the job.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
 * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The

 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
 * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
 * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
 * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API

 * specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
 * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
 * Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2

 * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
 * for the specified OS family.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion]
 * This may differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this
 * case some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on
 * the currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
 * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
 * targetOSVersion.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS

 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies
 * only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to
 * true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If
 * you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
 * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes]
 * This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If

 * must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale
 * is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
 * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, at least one of targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must
 * be specified. If true, the autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool
 * automatically resizes according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is

 * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration]
 * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings] When this
 * is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
 * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
 * container, all task environment variables are mapped into the container, and
 * the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.imageName]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If
 * no tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a

 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry]
 * This setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]

 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope]
 * The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch
 * service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
 * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences]
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationLicenses]
 * The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
 * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool
 * creation will fail.
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch
 * service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of
 * user code.
 * @member {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should
 * take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. The default is
 * noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 * @member {string} [onTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should take
 * when any task in the job fails. A task is considered to have failed if has a
 * failureInfo. A failureInfo is set if the task completes with a non-zero exit
 * code after exhausting its retry count, or if there was an error starting the
 * task, for example due to a resource file download error. The default is
 * noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata;
 * it is solely for the use of user code.
 * @member {object} [executionInfo] The execution information for the job.
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.startTime] This is the time at which the job
 * was created.
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.endTime] This property is set only if the job
 * is in the completed state.
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.poolId] This element contains the actual
 * pool where the job is assigned. When you get job details from the service,
 * they also contain a poolInfo element, which contains the pool configuration
 * data from when the job was added or updated. That poolInfo element may also
 * contain a poolId element. If it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does
 * not, it means the job ran on an auto pool, and this property contains the ID
 * of that auto pool.
 * @member {object} [executionInfo.schedulingError] This property is not set if
 * there was no error starting the job.
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.category] Possible values
 * include: 'userError', 'serverError'
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.code]
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.schedulingError.message]
 * @member {array} [executionInfo.schedulingError.details]
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.terminateReason] This property is set only
 * if the job is in the completed state. If the Batch service terminates the
 * job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete - the Job Manager task
 * completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry -
 * the job reached its maxWallClockTime constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the
 * job ran as part of a schedule, and the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete
 * - the job's onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminatejob, and all
 * tasks in the job are complete. TaskFailed - the job's onTaskFailure
 * attribute is set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a task in the job
 * failed with an exit condition that specified a jobAction of terminatejob.
 * Any other string is a user-defined reason specified in a call to the
 * 'Terminate a job' operation.
 * @member {object} [stats] Resource usage statistics for the entire lifetime
 * of the job. The statistics may not be immediately available. The Batch
 * service performs periodic roll-up of statistics. The typical delay is about
 * 30 minutes.
 * @member {string} [stats.url]
 * @member {date} [stats.startTime]
 * @member {date} [stats.lastUpdateTime]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.userCPUTime]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.kernelCPUTime]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.wallClockTime] The wall clock time is the
 * elapsed time from when the task started running on a compute node to when it
 * finished (or to the last time the statistics were updated, if the task had
 * not finished by then). If a task was retried, this includes the wall clock
 * time of all the task retries.
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOps]
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOps]
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOGiB]
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOGiB]
 * @member {number} [stats.numSucceededTasks] A task completes successfully if
 * it returns exit code 0.
 * @member {number} [stats.numFailedTasks] A task fails if it exhausts its
 * maximum retry count without returning exit code 0.
 * @member {number} [stats.numTaskRetries]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.waitTime] The wait time for a task is
 * defined as the elapsed time between the creation of the task and the start
 * of task execution. (If the task is retried due to failures, the wait time is
 * the time to the most recent task execution.) This value is only reported in
 * the account lifetime statistics; it is not included in the job statistics.

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobAddParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary An Azure Batch job to add.
 *
 * @member {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the job within the
 * account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
 * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may
 * not have two IDs within an account that differ only by case).
 * @member {string} [displayName] The display name for the job. The display
 * name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a
 * maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {number} [priority] The priority of the job. Priority values can
 * range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000
 * being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for the job.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the job does not
 * complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any
 * tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be
 * MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time
 * limit on how long the job may run.
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks
 * without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask] Details of a Job Manager task to be
 * launched when the job is started. If the job does not specify a Job Manager
 * task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job. If the job does specify
 * a Job Manager task, the Batch service creates the Job Manager task when the
 * job is created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager task before
 * scheduling other tasks in the job. The Job Manager task's typical purpose is
 * to control and/or monitor job execution, for example by deciding what
 * additional tasks to run, determining when the work is complete, etc.
 * (However, a Job Manager task is not restricted to these activities - it is a
 * fully-fledged task in the system and perform whatever actions are required
 * for the job.) For example, a Job Manager task might download a file
 * specified as a parameter, analyze the contents of that file and submit
 * additional tasks based on those contents.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not be unique and can
 * contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If the pool that will
 * run this task has containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If
 * the pool that will run this task doesn't have containerConfiguration set,
 * this must not be set. When this is specified, all directories recursively
 * below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the
 * node) are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are
 * mapped into the container, and the task command line is executed in the
 * container.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
 * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
 * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory. There is a maximum size
 * for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the task cannot be
 * added and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
 * occurs the recommended solution is to use an ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For multi-instance tasks, the
 * files will only be uploaded from the compute node on which the primary task
 * is executed.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If true, when the Job
 * Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any
 * tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks
 * are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not
 * affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the
 * onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user
 * terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager
 * creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.
 * The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and
 * onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager
 * task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it
 * is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as
 * a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no other tasks will
 * run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If
 * false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute
 * node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent
 * task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent
 * tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
 * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
 * copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot
 * be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array} [jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The default value is
 * true.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task. If a job has
 * a Job Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task
 * on a compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute
 * node.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain any combination
 * of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot
 * contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the
 * Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If you try to
 * submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with
 * error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The command line does not
 * run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features
 * such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of
 * such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
 * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If
 * the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path
 * (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided
 * environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings] When this is
 * specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the
 * root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container,
 * all task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
 * command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
 * the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag
 * is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
 * default.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry] This
 * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
 * the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
 * element are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime]
 * If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may
 * run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The
 * default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the
 * compute node is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the Job
 * Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job
 * Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the
 * constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after
 * all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to
 * the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks
 * of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job
 * Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start
 * executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still
 * running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue
 * to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs
 * as a non-administrative user unique to the task on Windows nodes, or a a
 * non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux nodes.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
 * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
 * both.
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
 * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTask] The Job Release task. A Job Release task
 * cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the
 * job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute nodes that
 * have run the Job Preparation task. The primary purpose of the Job Release
 * task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task.
 * Example activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services
 * that were started as part of job preparation.
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any combination of
 * alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain
 * more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch
 * service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in the job
 * can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task
 * with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
 * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using

 * @member {object} poolInfo The pool on which the Batch service runs the job's
 * tasks.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the

 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
 * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
 * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
 * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot be
 * specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
 * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
 * Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2

 * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
 * for the specified OS family.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion]
 * This may differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this

 * the currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
 * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
 * targetOSVersion.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS

 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
 * node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
 * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration]
 * This property must not be specified if the imageReference or osDisk property
 * specifies a Linux OS image.

 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
 * If omitted, the default value is true.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks]
 * This property must be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to
 * have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node
 * gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be
 * attached, each attached disk is empty. When the node is removed from the
 * pool, the disk and all data associated with it is also deleted. The disk is
 * not formatted after being attached, it must be formatted before use - for
 * more information see
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/classic/attach-disk#initialize-a-new-data-disk-in-linux
 * and

 * must specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may specify
 * it.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". An
 * image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image is
 * fully qualified with an alternative registry.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries]
 * If any images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
 * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.maxTasksPerNode] The
 * default value is 1. The maximum value of this setting depends on the size of
 * the compute nodes in the pool (the vmSize setting).
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy]
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies
 * only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to
 * true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If
 * you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
 * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes]
 * This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
 * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either
 * targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetLowPriorityNodes] This property
 * must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale
 * is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
 * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, at least one of targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must
 * be specified. If true, the autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool
 * automatically resizes according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and
 * 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling
 * inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The
 * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration]
 * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings] When this
 * is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
 * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
 * container, all task environment variables are mapped into the container, and
 * the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.imageName]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If
 * no tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
 * default.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry]
 * This setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]

 * task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope]
 * The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch
 * service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
 * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationPackageReferences]
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.applicationLicenses]
 * The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
 * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool
 * creation will fail.
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.userAccounts]
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.metadata] The Batch
 * service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of
 * user code.
 * @member {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should
 * take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. Note that if a
 * job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option
 * is therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 * @member {string} [onTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should take
 * when any task in the job fails. A task is considered to have failed if has a
 * failureInfo. A failureInfo is set if the task completes with a non-zero exit
 * code after exhausting its retry count, or if there was an error starting the
 * task, for example due to a resource file download error. The default is
 * noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata;
 * it is solely for the use of user code.
 * @member {boolean} [usesTaskDependencies] Whether tasks in the job can define
 * dependencies on each other. The default is false.

 * specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may specify it.
 * @member {array}
 * [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". An
 * image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image is
 * fully qualified with an alternative registry.
 * @member {array}
 * [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries] If
 * any images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
 * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
 * @member {moment.duration} [resizeTimeout] The timeout for allocation of
 * compute nodes to the pool. This is the timeout for the most recent resize
 * operation. (The initial sizing when the pool is created counts as a resize.)
 * The default value is 15 minutes.
 * @member {array} [resizeErrors] A list of errors encountered while performing
 * the last resize on the pool. This property is set only if one or more errors
 * occurred during the last pool resize, and only when the pool allocationState
 * is Steady.
 * @member {number} [currentDedicatedNodes] The number of dedicated compute
 * nodes currently in the pool.

 * compute nodes in the pool. This property is set only if the pool
 * automatically scales, i.e. enableAutoScale is true.
 * @member {moment.duration} [autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The time interval at
 * which to automatically adjust the pool size according to the autoscale
 * formula. This property is set only if the pool automatically scales, i.e.
 * enableAutoScale is true.
 * @member {object} [autoScaleRun] The results and errors from the last
 * execution of the autoscale formula. This property is set only if the pool
 * automatically scales, i.e. enableAutoScale is true.

 * @member {string} [autoScaleRun.error.message]
 * @member {array} [autoScaleRun.error.values]
 * @member {boolean} [enableInterNodeCommunication] Whether the pool permits
 * direct communication between nodes. This imposes restrictions on which nodes
 * can be assigned to the pool. Specifying this value can reduce the chance of
 * the requested number of nodes to be allocated in the pool.
 * @member {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for the
 * pool.
 * @member {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network must be
 * in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
 * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the
 * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
 * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
 * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the
 * 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
 * for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from
 * the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes.
 * This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
 * Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the
 * specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the
 * state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool endpoint
 * configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [startTask] A task specified to run on each compute node as
 * it joins the pool.
 * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run under
 * a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified, all
 * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure
 * Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
 * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command,
 * in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the full
 * image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
 * omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If
 * omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]

 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [certificateReferences] The list of certificates to be
 * installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the
 * Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store
 * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
 * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the PoolAddParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary A pool in the Azure Batch service to add.
 *
 * @member {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the pool within the
 * account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
 * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may
 * not have two pool IDs within an account that differ only by case).

 * storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
 * @member {object} [cloudServiceConfiguration] The cloud service configuration
 * for the pool. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually
 * exclusive and one of the properties must be specified. This property cannot
 * be specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
 * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 * @member {string} [cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily] Possible values are: 2
 * - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. 3 - OS Family 3,
 * equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4, equivalent to Windows
 * Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows Server 2016. For more
 * information, see Azure Guest OS Releases
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
 * @member {string} [cloudServiceConfiguration.targetOSVersion] The default
 * value is * which specifies the latest operating system version for the
 * specified OS family.
 * @member {string} [cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion] This may
 * differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this case
 * some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on the
 * currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines have
 * upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as targetOSVersion.
 * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration] The virtual machine
 * configuration for the pool. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration are
 * mutually exclusive and one of the properties must be specified.
 * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference]
 * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.publisher] For
 * example, Canonical or MicrosoftWindowsServer.
 * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.offer] For
 * example, UbuntuServer or WindowsServer.
 * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.sku] For
 * example, 14.04.0-LTS or 2012-R2-Datacenter.
 * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.version] A
 * value of 'latest' can be specified to select the latest version of an image.
 * If omitted, the default is 'latest'.
 * @member {string}
 * [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.virtualMachineImageId] This
 * property is mutually exclusive with other ImageReference properties. The
 * virtual machine image must be in the same region and subscription as the
 * Azure Batch account. For information about the firewall settings for the
 * Batch node agent to communicate with the Batch service see
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.
 * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk]
 * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.caching] The default
 * value for caching is none. For information about the caching options see:
 * https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazurestorage/2012/06/27/exploring-windows-azure-drives-disks-and-images/.
 * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
 * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId] The Batch node
 * agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the
 * command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service. There
 * are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for
 * different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches
 * the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs
 * along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported
 * node agent SKUs' operation.
 * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration] This
 * property must not be specified if the imageReference or osDisk property
 * specifies a Linux OS image.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates] If
 * omitted, the default value is true.
 * @member {array} [virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks] This property must
 * be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data disks
 * attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node gets its own disk (the
 * disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be attached, each attached
 * disk is empty. When the node is removed from the pool, the disk and all data
 * associated with it is also deleted. The disk is not formatted after being
 * attached, it must be formatted before use - for more information see
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/classic/attach-disk#initialize-a-new-data-disk-in-linux
 * and
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-disk-ps#add-an-empty-data-disk-to-a-virtual-machine.
 * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType] This only applies
 * to images that contain the Windows operating system, and should only be used
 * when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes which will be
 * deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is applied. Values
 * are:
 *
 * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
 * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
 * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration] If
 * specified, setup is performed on each node in the pool to allow tasks to run
 * in containers. All regular tasks and job manager tasks run on this pool must
 * specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may specify it.
 * @member {array}
 * [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". An
 * image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image is
 * fully qualified with an alternative registry.
 * @member {array}
 * [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries] If
 * any images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
 * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
 * @member {moment.duration} [resizeTimeout] The timeout for allocation of
 * compute nodes to the pool. This timeout applies only to manual scaling; it
 * has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15
 * minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5
 * minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number} [targetDedicatedNodes] The desired number of dedicated
 * compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if
 * enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you
 * must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {number} [targetLowPriorityNodes] The desired number of low-priority
 * compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if
 * enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you
 * must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {boolean} [enableAutoScale] Whether the pool size should
 * automatically adjust over time. If false, at least one of
 * targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must be specified. If true,
 * the autoScaleFormula property is required and the pool automatically resizes
 * according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string} [autoScaleFormula] A formula for the desired number of
 * compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if
 * enableAutoScale is set to false. It is required if enableAutoScale is set to
 * true. The formula is checked for validity before the pool is created. If the
 * formula is not valid, the Batch service rejects the request with detailed
 * error information. For more information about specifying this formula, see
 * 'Automatically scale compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool'
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling/).
 * @member {moment.duration} [autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The time interval at
 * which to automatically adjust the pool size according to the autoscale
 * formula. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are
 * 5 minutes and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5
 * minutes or greater than 168 hours, the Batch service returns an error; if
 * you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {boolean} [enableInterNodeCommunication] Whether the pool permits
 * direct communication between nodes. Enabling inter-node communication limits
 * the maximum size of the pool due to deployment restrictions on the nodes of
 * the pool. This may result in the pool not reaching its desired size. The
 * default value is false.
 * @member {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for the
 * pool.
 * @member {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network must be
 * in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
 * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the
 * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
 * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
 * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the
 * 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
 * for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from
 * the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes.
 * This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
 * Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the
 * specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the
 * state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool endpoint
 * configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [startTask] A task specified to run on each compute node as
 * it joins the pool. The task runs when the node is added to the pool or when
 * the node is restarted.
 * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run under
 * a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified, all
 * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure
 * Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
 * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command,
 * in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the full
 * image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
 * omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If
 * omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this element
 * are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
 * non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value
 * is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [certificateReferences] The list of certificates to be
 * installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the
 * Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store
 * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
 * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
 * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
 * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
 * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] The list of application
 * packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
 * @member {array} [applicationLicenses] The list of application licenses the
 * Batch service will make available on each compute node in the pool. The list
 * of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
 * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool
 * creation will fail.
 * @member {number} [maxTasksPerNode] The maximum number of tasks that can run
 * concurrently on a single compute node in the pool. The default value is 1.
 * The maximum value of this setting depends on the size of the compute nodes
 * in the pool (the vmSize setting).
 * @member {object} [taskSchedulingPolicy] How tasks are distributed across
 * compute nodes in a pool.
 * @member {string} [taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] Possible values
 * include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {array} [userAccounts] The list of user accounts to be created on
 * each node in the pool.
 * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata;
 * it is solely for the use of user code.

 * state. In general, the exit code for a process reflects the specific
 * convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If you
 * use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you
 * know the exit code convention used by the application process. However, if

 * retried, pre-processing errors (the task could not be run) and file upload
 * errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the task up to the
 * limit specified by the constraints.
 * @member {date} [lastRetryTime] The most recent time at which a retry of the

 * returns an error and the add task request fails with an invalid property
 * value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code
 * is 400 (Bad Request). Possible values include: 'none', 'disable',

 * @member {object} [exitConditions.default] This value is used if the task
 * exits with any nonzero exit code not listed in the exitCodes or
 * exitCodeRanges collection, with a pre-processing error if the

 * include: 'active', 'preparing', 'running', 'completed'
 * @member {date} [stateTransitionTime] The time at which the task entered its
 * current state.
 * @member {string} [previousState] The previous state of the task. This
 * property is not set if the task is in its initial Active state. Possible
 * values include: 'active', 'preparing', 'running', 'completed'
 * @member {date} [previousStateTransitionTime] The time at which the task
 * entered its previous state. This property is not set if the task is in its
 * initial Active state.
 * @member {string} [commandLine] The command line of the task. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the command line is executed as the primary task,
 * after the primary task and all subtasks have finished executing the
 * coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and
 * therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
 * variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you
 * should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c
 * MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
 * line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the
 * task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container under
 * which the task runs. If the pool that will run this task has
 * containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If the pool that will
 * run this task doesn't have containerConfiguration set, this must not be set.
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
 * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
 * mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into
 * the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These additional
 * options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command, in
 * addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full image
 * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided as
 * part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be omitted if
 * was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted, the
 * default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string} [containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * download to the compute node before running the command line. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the
 * compute node on which the primary task is executed. There is a maximum size
 * for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the task cannot be
 * added and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
 * occurs the recommended solution is to use an ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * upload from the compute node after running the command line. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node
 * on which the primary task is executed.
 * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the task.
 * @member {object} [affinityInfo] A locality hint that can be used by the
 * Batch service to select a compute node on which to start the new task.
 * @member {string} [affinityInfo.affinityId] You can pass the affinityId of a
 * compute node to indicate that this task needs to run on that compute node.
 * Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target node is busy or
 * unavailable at the time the task is scheduled, then the task will be
 * scheduled elsewhere.
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints that apply to this
 * task.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to a
 * nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then
 * retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch
 * tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum
 * retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after the first
 * attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit. Resource files and application packages are only
 * downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute node.
 * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the task runs.
 * If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is task.
 * Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default value is
 * nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {object} [executionInfo] Information about the execution of the
 * task.
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.startTime] 'Running' corresponds to the
 * running state, so if the task specifies resource files or application
 * packages, then the start time reflects the time at which the task started
 * downloading or deploying these. If the task has been restarted or retried,
 * this is the most recent time at which the task started running. This
 * property is present only for tasks that are in the running or completed
 * state.
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.endTime] This property is set only if the task
 * is in the Completed state.
 * @member {number} [executionInfo.exitCode] This property is set only if the
 * task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a process
 * reflects the specific convention implemented by the application developer
 * for that process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your
 * code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the application
 * process. However, if the Batch service terminates the task (due to timeout,
 * or user termination via the API) you may see an operating system-defined
 * exit code.
 * @member {object} [executionInfo.containerInfo] This property is set only if
 * the task runs in a container context.
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.containerInfo.containerId]
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.containerInfo.state] This is the state of
 * the container according to the Docker service. It is equivalent to the
 * status field returned by "docker inspect".
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.containerInfo.error] This is the detailed
 * error string from the Docker service, if available. It is equivalent to the
 * error field returned by "docker inspect".
 * @member {object} [executionInfo.failureInfo] This property is set only if
 * the task is in the completed state and encountered a failure.
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.failureInfo.category] Possible values
 * include: 'userError', 'serverError'
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.failureInfo.code]
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.failureInfo.message]
 * @member {array} [executionInfo.failureInfo.details]
 * @member {number} [executionInfo.retryCount] Task application failures
 * (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the task could not
 * be run) and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry
 * the task up to the limit specified by the constraints.
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.lastRetryTime] This element is present only if
 * the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is
 * typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been
 * restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node was
 * rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime
 * is not.
 * @member {number} [executionInfo.requeueCount] When the user removes nodes
 * from a pool (by resizing/shrinking the pool) or when the job is being
 * disabled, the user can specify that running tasks on the nodes be requeued
 * for execution. This count tracks how many times the task has been requeued
 * for these reasons.
 * @member {date} [executionInfo.lastRequeueTime] This property is set only if
 * the requeueCount is nonzero.
 * @member {string} [executionInfo.result] If the value is 'failed', then the
 * details of the failure can be found in the failureInfo property. Possible
 * values include: 'success', 'failure'
 * @member {object} [nodeInfo] Information about the compute node on which the
 * task ran.
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.affinityId]
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.nodeUrl]
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.poolId]
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.nodeId]
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.taskRootDirectory]
 * @member {string} [nodeInfo.taskRootDirectoryUrl]
 * @member {object} [multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that the
 * task is a multi-instance task, and contains information about how to run the
 * multi-instance task.
 * @member {number} [multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances] If omitted, the
 * default is 1.
 * @member {string} [multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine] A typical
 * coordination command line launches a background service and verifies that
 * the service is ready to process inter-node messages.
 * @member {array} [multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] The difference
 * between common resource files and task resource files is that common
 * resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary,
 * whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note
 * that these resource files are not downloaded to the task working directory,
 * but instead are downloaded to the task root directory (one directory above
 * the working directory).
 * @member {object} [stats] Resource usage statistics for the task.
 * @member {string} [stats.url]
 * @member {date} [stats.startTime]
 * @member {date} [stats.lastUpdateTime]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.userCPUTime]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.kernelCPUTime]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.wallClockTime] The wall clock time is the
 * elapsed time from when the task started running on a compute node to when it
 * finished (or to the last time the statistics were updated, if the task had
 * not finished by then). If the task was retried, this includes the wall clock
 * time of all the task retries.
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOps]
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOps]
 * @member {number} [stats.readIOGiB]
 * @member {number} [stats.writeIOGiB]
 * @member {moment.duration} [stats.waitTime]
 * @member {object} [dependsOn] The tasks that this task depends on. This task
 * will not be scheduled until all tasks that it depends on have completed
 * successfully. If any of those tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts,
 * this task will never be scheduled.
 * @member {array} [dependsOn.taskIds] The taskIds collection is limited to
 * 64000 characters total (i.e. the combined length of all task IDs). If the
 * taskIds collection exceeds the maximum length, the Add Task request fails
 * with error code TaskDependencyListTooLong. In this case consider using task
 * ID ranges instead.
 * @member {array} [dependsOn.taskIdRanges]
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
 * packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
 * running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed
 * to a shared directory, not the task working directory. Therefore, if a
 * referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then
 * it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a
 * referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the
 * package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object} [authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
 * authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service
 * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task
 * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
 * operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
 * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
 * that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
 * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
 * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array} [authenticationTokenSettings.access] The authentication
 * token grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently
 * the only supported value for the access property is 'job', which grants
 * access to all operations related to the job which contains the task.

 * 'satisfy' for exit code 0, and 'block' for all other exit conditions. If the
 * job's usesTaskDependencies property is set to false, then specifying the
 * dependencyAction property returns an error and the add task request fails
 * with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400  (Bad Request). Possible values
 * include: 'satisfy', 'block'
 * @member {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * download to the compute node before running the command line. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the
 * compute node on which the primary task is executed. There is a maximum size
 * for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the task cannot be
 * added and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
 * occurs the recommended solution is to use an ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service will
 * upload from the compute node after running the command line. For
 * multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node
 * on which the primary task is executed.
 * @member {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the task.
 * @member {object} [affinityInfo] A locality hint that can be used by the
 * Batch service to select a compute node on which to start the new task.
 * @member {string} [affinityInfo.affinityId] You can pass the affinityId of a
 * compute node to indicate that this task needs to run on that compute node.
 * Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target node is busy or
 * unavailable at the time the task is scheduled, then the task will be
 * scheduled elsewhere.
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints that apply to this
 * task. If you do not specify constraints, the maxTaskRetryCount is the
 * maxTaskRetryCount specified for the job, and the maxWallClockTime and
 * retentionTime are infinite.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to a
 * nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then
 * retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch
 * tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum
 * retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after the first
 * attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit. Resource files and application packages are only
 * downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute node.
 * @member {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the task runs.
 * If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is task.
 * Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default value is
 * nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {object} [multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that the
 * task is a multi-instance task, and contains information about how to run the
 * multi-instance task.
 * @member {number} [multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances] If omitted, the
 * default is 1.
 * @member {string} [multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine] A typical
 * coordination command line launches a background service and verifies that
 * the service is ready to process inter-node messages.
 * @member {array} [multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] The difference
 * between common resource files and task resource files is that common
 * resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary,
 * whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note
 * that these resource files are not downloaded to the task working directory,
 * but instead are downloaded to the task root directory (one directory above
 * the working directory).
 * @member {object} [dependsOn] The tasks that this task depends on. This task
 * will not be scheduled until all tasks that it depends on have completed
 * successfully. If any of those tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts,
 * this task will never be scheduled. If the job does not have
 * usesTaskDependencies set to true, and this element is present, the request
 * fails with error code TaskDependenciesNotSpecifiedOnJob.
 * @member {array} [dependsOn.taskIds] The taskIds collection is limited to
 * 64000 characters total (i.e. the combined length of all task IDs). If the
 * taskIds collection exceeds the maximum length, the Add Task request fails
 * with error code TaskDependencyListTooLong. In this case consider using task
 * ID ranges instead.
 * @member {array} [dependsOn.taskIdRanges]
 * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of application
 * packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
 * running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed
 * to a shared directory, not the task working directory. Therefore, if a
 * referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then
 * it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a
 * referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the
 * package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object} [authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
 * authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service
 * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task
 * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
 * operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided
 * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
 * that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
 * example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to
 * the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array} [authenticationTokenSettings.access] The authentication
 * token grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently
 * the only supported value for the access property is 'job', which grants
 * access to all operations related to the job which contains the task.

 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this element
 * are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
 * non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value
 * is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {object} [startTaskInfo] Runtime information about the execution of
 * the start task on the compute node.
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.state] Possible values include: 'running',
 * 'completed'
 * @member {date} [startTaskInfo.startTime] This value is reset every time the
 * task is restarted or retried (that is, this is the most recent time at which
 * the start task started running).
 * @member {date} [startTaskInfo.endTime] This is the end time of the most
 * recent run of the start task, if that run has completed (even if that run
 * failed and a retry is pending). This element is not present if the start
 * task is currently running.
 * @member {number} [startTaskInfo.exitCode] This property is set only if the
 * start task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
 * process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application
 * developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions
 * in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the
 * application process. However, if the Batch service terminates the start task
 * (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an operating
 * system-defined exit code.
 * @member {object} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo] This property is set only if
 * the task runs in a container context.
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.containerId]
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.state] This is the state of
 * the container according to the Docker service. It is equivalent to the
 * status field returned by "docker inspect".
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.containerInfo.error] This is the detailed
 * error string from the Docker service, if available. It is equivalent to the
 * error field returned by "docker inspect".
 * @member {object} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo] This property is set only if
 * the task is in the completed state and encountered a failure.
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.category] Possible values
 * include: 'userError', 'serverError'
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.code]
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.message]
 * @member {array} [startTaskInfo.failureInfo.details]
 * @member {number} [startTaskInfo.retryCount] Task application failures
 * (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the task could not
 * be run) and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry
 * the task up to the limit specified by the constraints.
 * @member {date} [startTaskInfo.lastRetryTime] This element is present only if
 * the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is
 * typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been
 * restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node was
 * rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime
 * is not.
 * @member {string} [startTaskInfo.result] If the value is 'failed', then the
 * details of the failure can be found in the failureInfo property. Possible
 * values include: 'success', 'failure'
 * @member {array} [certificateReferences] The list of certificates installed
 * on the compute node. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs
 * the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux
 * compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task
 * working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is
 * supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with
 * visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's
 * home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed
 * in that directory.
 * @member {array} [errors] The list of errors that are currently being
 * encountered by the compute node.
 * @member {boolean} [isDedicated] Whether this compute node is a dedicated
 * node. If false, the node is a low-priority node.
 * @member {object} [endpointConfiguration] The endpoint configuration for the
 * compute node.
 * @member {array} [endpointConfiguration.inboundEndpoints]

 * @summary The set of changes to be made to a job schedule.
 *
 * @member {object} [schedule] The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created. If you do not specify this element, the existing schedule is left
 * unchanged.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification] The details of the jobs to be created on
 * this schedule. Updates affect only jobs that are started after the update
 * has taken place. Any currently active job continues with the older
 * specification.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noaction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
 * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
 * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
 * 1024.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative
 * path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided
 * environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings] If the
 * pool that will run this task has containerConfiguration set, this must be
 * set as well. If the pool that will run this task doesn't have
 * containerConfiguration set, this must not be set. When this is specified,
 * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
 * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
 * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting
 * can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory. There is a
 * maximum size for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the
 * task cannot be added and the response error code will be
 * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs the recommended solution is to use an
 * ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For
 * multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node
 * on which the primary task is executed.
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is
 * not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,
 * the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.userName] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The
 * userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify
 * one but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
 * value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
 * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
 * copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot
 * be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The
 * default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings]
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
 * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
 * mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into
 * the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is
 * the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag
 * is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
 * default.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry] This
 * setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.resourceFiles] Files
 * listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.environmentSettings]
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this
 * is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default
 * is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node
 * is removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
 * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
 * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
 * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of
 * the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation
 * task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
 * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task on
 * Windows nodes, or a a non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux
 * nodes.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must
 * specify one but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The
 * default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a
 * task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take

 * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive
 * is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the

 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks]
 * This property must be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to
 * have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node
 * gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be
 * attached, each attached disk is empty. When the node is removed from the

 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This
 * timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when
 * enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum
 * value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes]
 * This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
 * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either
 * targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetLowPriorityNodes]
 * This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
 * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either

 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, at least one of targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must
 * be specified. If true, the autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool
 * automatically resizes according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval]
 * The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes
 * and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication]
 * Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
 * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object}

 * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings]
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
 * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
 * mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into
 * the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.

 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount]
 * The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this
 * value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
 * try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
 * maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
 * try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does
 * not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
 * retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess]
 * If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If
 * the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the
 * Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks
 * to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info
 * details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to
 * complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node
 * while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new
 * tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobScheduleUpdateParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary The set of changes to be made to a job schedule.
 *
 * @member {object} schedule The schedule according to which jobs will be
 * created. If you do not specify this element, it is equivalent to passing the
 * default schedule: that is, a single job scheduled to run immediately.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunUntil] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.
 * @member {date} [schedule.doNotRunAfter] If you do not specify a
 * doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job
 * schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.startWindow] If a job is not created
 * within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will
 * be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is
 * recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then
 * this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due'
 * in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence
 * interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you
 * specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error;
 * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {moment.duration} [schedule.recurrenceInterval] Because a job
 * schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it
 * is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is
 * still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the
 * previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the
 * startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be
 * scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify
 * a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask,
 * you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add
 * tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The
 * default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the
 * startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as
 * soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a
 * lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
 * are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
 * Request).
 * @member {object} jobSpecification Details of the jobs to be created on this
 * schedule. Updates affect only jobs that are started after the update has
 * taken place. Any currently active job continues with the older
 * specification.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.priority] Priority values can range from
 * -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the
 * highest priority. The default value is 0. This priority is used as the
 * default for all jobs under the job schedule. You can update a job's priority
 * after it has been created using by using the update job API.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.displayName] The name need not be unique
 * and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.usesTaskDependencies]
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onAllTasksComplete] Note that if a job
 * contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is
 * therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
 * automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
 * onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set
 * onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The
 * default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.onTaskFailure] The default is noaction.
 * Possible values include: 'noAction', 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.constraints]
 * @member {moment.duration} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxWallClockTime] If
 * the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the
 * termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not
 * specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.
 * @member {number} [jobSpecification.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service
 * will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example,
 * if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one
 * initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch
 * service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask] If the job does not
 * specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job
 * using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
 * service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try
 * to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.displayName] It need not
 * be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of
 * 1024.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in
 * Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative
 * path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided

 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.resourceFiles] Files listed
 * under this element are located in the task's working directory. There is a
 * maximum size for the list of resource files.  When this is exceeded, the
 * task cannot be added and the response error code will be
 * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs the recommended solution is to use an
 * ApplicationPackage.
 * @member {array} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.outputFiles] For

 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.retentionTime] The default is
 * infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is
 * removed or reimaged.
 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that
 * this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task
 * executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task
 * once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
 * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the
 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.killJobOnCompletion] If
 * true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job
 * as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job
 * Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job
 * Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either
 * use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client
 * or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job
 * Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
 * execution. The default value is true. If you are using the
 * onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and
 * using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to
 * monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity] If omitted,

 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.runExclusive] If true, no
 * other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager
 * is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job
 * Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the
 * node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows
 * multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.applicationPackageReferences] Application
 * packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task
 * working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the
 * compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing
 * copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot
 * be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
 * download failed, the task fails.
 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings] If this
 * property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication
 * token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without
 * requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
 * AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the
 * task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a
 * task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or
 * check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.
 * @member {array}
 * [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The
 * authentication token grants access to a limited set of Batch service
 * operations. Currently the only supported value for the access property is
 * 'job', which grants access to all operations related to the job which
 * contains the task.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobManagerTask.allowLowPriorityNode] The
 * default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask] If a job has a Job
 * Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a
 * compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.id] The ID can contain
 * any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores
 * and cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this
 * property, the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobpreparation'. No
 * other task in the job can have the same ID as the Job Preparation task. If
 * you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask; if you are calling
 * the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.commandLine] The
 * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage
 * of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
 * take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command
 * line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.containerSettings]

 * @member {number}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note
 * that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task

 * Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application
 * packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute
 * node.
 * @member {boolean} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.waitForSuccess] If
 * true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
 * retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified
 * in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule
 * tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and
 * eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not
 * wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of
 * the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation
 * task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity] If
 * omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task on
 * Windows nodes, or a a non-administrative user unique to the pool on Linux
 * nodes.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.userName]
 * The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must

 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel]
 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.jobPreparationTask.rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess] The Job
 * Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the
 * Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred
 * while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job
 * Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple
 * times. The default value is true.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask] The primary purpose of
 * the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
 * Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or
 * shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation. A Job
 * Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation
 * task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
 * nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.id] The ID can contain any
 * combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and
 * cannot contain more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property,
 * the Batch service assigns a default value of 'jobrelease'. No other task in
 * the job can have the same ID as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a
 * task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with error code
 * TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.commandLine] The command
 * line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
 * shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take
 * advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line,
 * for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in

 * environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.jobReleaseTask.containerSettings] When
 * this is specified, all directories recursively below the

 * same setting name with a different value.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo]
 * @member {string} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the
 * pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the
 * time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will
 * run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will
 * not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool
 * exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification,
 * but not both.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto
 * pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state,
 * and the pool creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property.
 * The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive
 * is specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 * @member {string}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
 * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
 * @member {boolean}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 * @member {object} [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]

 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration]
 * This property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure

 * @member {object}
 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration]
 * This property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure

 * [jobSpecification.poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId]
 * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure

 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,

 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are

/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobUpdateParameter class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary The set of changes to be made to a job.
 *
 * @member {number} [priority] The priority of the job. Priority values can
 * range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000
 * being the highest priority. If omitted, it is set to the default value 0.
 * @member {object} [constraints] The execution constraints for the job. If
 * omitted, the constraints are cleared.
 * @member {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If the job does not
 * complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any
 * tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be
 * MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time
 * limit on how long the job may run.
 * @member {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks
 * without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
 * @member {object} poolInfo The pool on which the Batch service runs the job's
 * tasks. You may change the pool for a job only when the job is disabled. The
 * Update Job call will fail if you include the poolInfo element and the job is
 * not disabled. If you specify an autoPoolSpecification specification in the
 * poolInfo, only the keepAlive property can be updated, and then only if the
 * auto pool has a poolLifetimeOption of job.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.poolId] You must ensure that the pool referenced
 * by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the time the Batch
 * service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will run until you
 * create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the
 * job request; it will simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must
 * specify either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification] If auto pool creation
 * fails, the Batch service moves the job to a completed state, and the pool
 * creation error is set in the job's scheduling error property. The Batch
 * service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless keepAlive is
 * specified, deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the
 * lifetime of the auto pool while the job is active will result in unexpected
 * behavior. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto pool
 * specification, but not both.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.autoPoolIdPrefix] The Batch
 * service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To
 * distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify
 * this element to add a prefix to the ID that is assigned. The prefix can be
 * up to 20 characters long.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.poolLifetimeOption]
 * Possible values include: 'jobSchedule', 'job'
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.keepAlive] If false, the
 * Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime (as determined by the
 * poolLifetimeOption setting) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule
 * completes. If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool
 * automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this
 * option.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool]
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.displayName] The
 * display name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to
 * a maximum length of 1024.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.vmSize] For
 * information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services
 * pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud
 * Services
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
 * Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and A2V2.
 * For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the
 * Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with
 * virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux)
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/)
 * or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows)
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/).
 * Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium
 * storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure PaaS
 * VMs. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration are mutually exclusive
 * and one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then
 * the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API
 * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). This property cannot be
 * specified if the Batch account was created with its poolAllocationMode
 * property set to 'UserSubscription'.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily]
 * Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2
 * SP1. 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4,
 * equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows
 * Server 2016. For more information, see Azure Guest OS Releases
 * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.targetOSVersion]
 * The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version
 * for the specified OS family.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion]
 * This may differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this
 * case some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on
 * the currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
 * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
 * targetOSVersion.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration] This
 * property must be specified if the pool needs to be created with Azure IaaS
 * VMs. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration are mutually exclusive and
 * one of the properties must be specified. If neither is specified then the
 * Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly,

 * A value of 'latest' can be specified to select the latest version of an
 * image. If omitted, the default is 'latest'.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.virtualMachineImageId]
 * This property is mutually exclusive with other ImageReference properties.
 * The virtual machine image must be in the same region and subscription as the

 * The default value for caching is none. For information about the caching
 * options see:
 * https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazurestorage/2012/06/27/exploring-windows-azure-drives-disks-and-images/.
 * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId]
 * The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
 * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
 * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
 * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU
 * which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
 * node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
 * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration]
 * This property must not be specified if the imageReference or osDisk property
 * specifies a Linux OS image.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
 * If omitted, the default value is true.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks]
 * This property must be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to
 * have empty data disks attached to them. This cannot be updated. Each node
 * gets its own disk (the disk is not a file share). Existing disks cannot be
 * attached, each attached disk is empty. When the node is removed from the
 * pool, the disk and all data associated with it is also deleted. The disk is
 * not formatted after being attached, it must be formatted before use - for
 * more information see
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/classic/attach-disk#initialize-a-new-data-disk-in-linux
 * and
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-disk-ps#add-an-empty-data-disk-to-a-virtual-machine.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType]
 * This only applies to images that contain the Windows operating system, and
 * should only be used when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes
 * which will be deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is
 * applied. Values are:
 *
 * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
 * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration]
 * If specified, setup is performed on each node in the pool to allow tasks to
 * run in containers. All regular tasks and job manager tasks run on this pool
 * must specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may specify
 * it.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". An
 * image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image is
 * fully qualified with an alternative registry.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries]
 * If any images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
 * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.maxTasksPerNode] The
 * default value is 1. The maximum value of this setting depends on the size of
 * the compute nodes in the pool (the vmSize setting).
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy]
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType]
 * Possible values include: 'spread', 'pack'
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.resizeTimeout] This timeout applies
 * only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to
 * true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If
 * you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the
 * request with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
 * status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {number} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetDedicatedNodes]
 * This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If
 * enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either
 * targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.targetLowPriorityNodes] This property
 * must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale
 * is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
 * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
 * @member {boolean} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableAutoScale] If
 * false, at least one of targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must
 * be specified. If true, the autoScaleFormula element is required. The pool
 * automatically resizes according to the formula. The default value is false.
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleFormula] This
 * property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is
 * required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for
 * validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch
 * service rejects the request with detailed error information.
 * @member {moment.duration}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The
 * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and
 * 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or
 * greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an
 * invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the
 * HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.enableInterNodeCommunication] Enabling
 * inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to
 * deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the
 * pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration]
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.subnetId] The
 * virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
 * Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to
 * accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have
 * enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes,
 * and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal
 * must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access
 * Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
 * communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on
 * the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet
 * has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the
 * compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch
 * service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools
 * created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
 * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
 * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
 * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
 * (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
 * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
 * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
 * Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports
 * 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage
 * on port 443. For more details see:
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration]
 * Pool endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
 * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
 * @member {array}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools]
 * The maximum number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum
 * number of inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status
 * code 400.
 * @member {object} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask]
 * @member {string} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.commandLine]
 * The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
 * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
 * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
 * command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c
 * MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use
 * a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch
 * provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings] When this
 * is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR
 * (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the
 * container, all task environment variables are mapped into the container, and
 * the task command line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions]
 * These additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
 * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.imageName]
 * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If
 * no tag is provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
 * default.
 * @member {object}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry]
 * This setting can be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
 * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".

 * The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch
 * service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value
 * specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the
 * task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum
 * retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
 * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry
 * the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the
 * task without limit.
 * @member {boolean}
 * [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and
 * the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
 * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
 * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
 * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
 * condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If
 * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
 * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
 * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
 * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} [poolInfo.autoPoolSpecification.pool.certificateReferences]
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,

 * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
 * job as metadata. If omitted, it takes the default value of an empty list; in
 * effect, any existing metadata is deleted.
 * @member {string} [onAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should
 * take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. If omitted, the
 * completion behavior is set to noaction. If the current value is
 * terminatejob, this is an error because a job's completion behavior may not
 * be changed from terminatejob to noaction. You may not change the value from
 * terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic job
 * termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

 * @constructor
 * @summary The set of changes to be made to a pool.
 *
 * @member {object} [startTask] A task to run on each compute node as it joins
 * the pool. The task runs when the node is added to the pool or when the node
 * is restarted. If this element is present, it overwrites any existing start
 * task. If omitted, any existing start task is removed from the pool.
 * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run under
 * a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as
 * environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
 * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using
 * "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the
 * command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
 * to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment
 * variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified, all
 * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure
 * Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
 * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
 * line is executed in the container.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
 * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command,
 * in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the full
 * image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
 * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
 * omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
 * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If
 * omitted, the default is "docker.io".

 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
 * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value
 * is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
 * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
 * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls
 * the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may
 * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
 * Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
 * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the
 * maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
 * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
 * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its
 * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
 * successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute
 * node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
 * detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch
 * service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other
 * tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still
 * running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be
 * scheduled on the node. The default is false.
 * @member {array} certificateReferences A list of certificates to be installed
 * on each compute node in the pool. This list replaces any existing
 * certificate references configured on the pool. If you specify an empty
 * collection, any existing certificate references are removed from the pool.
 * For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
 * the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the
 * certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and
 * an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to
 * query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a
 * 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
 * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
 * @member {array} applicationPackageReferences A list of application packages
 * to be installed on each compute node in the pool. The list replaces any
 * existing application package references on the pool. Changes to application
 * package references affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not
 * affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or
 * reimaged. If omitted, or if you specify an empty collection, any existing
 * application packages references are removed from the pool.
 * @member {array} metadata A list of name-value pairs associated with the pool
 * as metadata. This list replaces any existing metadata configured on the
 * pool. If omitted, or if you specify an empty collection, any existing
 * metadata is removed from the pool.
