 * for as long as possible (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running
 * Job Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to
 * schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle nodes available, the system may
 * terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room
 * for the Job Manager task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have
 * priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed. For
 * example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks
 * of a priority 1 job. Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute
 * node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy compute
 * node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery
 * operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
 * maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of
 * this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
