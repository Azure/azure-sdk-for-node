class TaskStatistics {
  /**
   * Create a TaskStatistics.
   * @member {string} url The URL of the statistics.
   * @member {date} startTime The start time of the time range covered by the
   * statistics.
   * @member {date} lastUpdateTime The time at which the statistics were last
   * updated. All statistics are limited to the range between startTime and
   * lastUpdateTime.
   * @member {moment.duration} userCPUTime The total user mode CPU time (summed
   * across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by the task.
   * @member {moment.duration} kernelCPUTime The total kernel mode CPU time
   * (summed across all cores and all compute nodes) consumed by the task.
   * @member {moment.duration} wallClockTime The total wall clock time of the
   * task. The wall clock time is the elapsed time from when the task started
   * running on a compute node to when it finished (or to the last time the
   * statistics were updated, if the task had not finished by then). If the
   * task was retried, this includes the wall clock time of all the task
   * retries.
   * @member {number} readIOps The total number of disk read operations made by
   * the task.
   * @member {number} writeIOps The total number of disk write operations made
   * by the task.
   * @member {number} readIOGiB The total gibibytes read from disk by the task.
   * @member {number} writeIOGiB The total gibibytes written to disk by the
   * task.
   * @member {moment.duration} waitTime The total wait time of the task. The
   * wait time for a task is defined as the elapsed time between the creation
   * of the task and the start of task execution. (If the task is retried due
   * to failures, the wait time is the time to the most recent task
   * execution.).
