/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobPreparationAndReleaseTaskExecutionInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary The status of the Job Preparation and Job Release tasks on a
 * compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolId] The ID of the pool containing the compute node to
 * which this entry refers.
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeId] The ID of the compute node to which this entry
 * refers.
 *
 * @member {string} [nodeUrl] The URL of the compute node to which this entry
 * refers.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo] Information about the
 * execution status of the Job Preparation task on this compute node.
 *
 * @member {date} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.startTime] Note that every
 * time the task is restarted, this value is updated.
 *
 * @member {date} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.endTime] This property is
 * set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.state] running - the task
 * is currently running (including retrying). completed - the task has exited
 * with exit code 0, or the task has exhausted its retry limit, or the Batch
 * service was unable to start the task due to scheduling errors. Possible
 * values include: 'running', 'completed'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.taskRootDirectory]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.taskRootDirectoryUrl]
 *
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.exitCode] This parameter
 * is returned only if the task is in the completed state. The exit code for a
 * process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application
 * developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions
 * in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the
 * application process. Note that the exit code may also be generated by the
 * compute node operating system, such as when a process is forcibly
 * terminated.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.category]
 * Possible values include: 'userError', 'serverError', 'unmapped'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.code]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.message]
 *
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.details]
 *
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.retryCount]
 *
 * @member {date} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.lastRetryTime] This property
 * is set only if the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If
 * present, this is typically the same as startTime, but may be different if
 * the task has been restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if
 * the compute node was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated
 * but the lastRetryTime is not.
 *
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo] Information about the
 * execution status of the Job Release task on this compute node. This property
 * is set only if the Job Release task has run on the node.
 *
 * @member {date} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.startTime]
 *
 * @member {date} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.endTime] This property is set
 * only if the task is in the Completed state.
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.state] running - the task is
 * currently running (including retrying). completed - the task has exited, or
 * the Batch service was unable to start the task due to scheduling errors.
 * Possible values include: 'running', 'completed'
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.taskRootDirectory]
 *
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.taskRootDirectoryUrl]
 *
 * @member {number} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.exitCode] This parameter is
 * returned only if the task is in the completed state. The exit code for a
 * process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application
 * developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions
 * in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the
 * application process. Note that the exit code may also be generated by the
 * compute node operating system, such as when a process is forcibly
 * terminated.
