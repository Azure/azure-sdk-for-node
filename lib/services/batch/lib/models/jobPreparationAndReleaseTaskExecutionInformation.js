/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the JobPreparationAndReleaseTaskExecutionInformation class.
 * @constructor
 * @summary The status of the Job Preparation and Job Release tasks on a
 * compute node.
 *
 * @member {string} [poolId] The id of the pool containing the compute node to
 * which this entry refers.
 * 
 * @member {string} [nodeId] The id of the compute node to which this entry
 * refers.
 * 
 * @member {string} [nodeUrl] The URL of the compute node to which this entry
 * refers.
 * 
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo] Information about the
 * execution status of the Job Preparation task on this compute node.
 * 
 * @member {date} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.startTime] Note that every
 * time the task is restarted, this value is updated.
 * 
 * @member {date} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.endTime] This property is
 * set only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.state] Possible values
 * include: 'running', 'completed'
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.taskRootDirectory]
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.taskRootDirectoryUrl]
 * 
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.exitCode] This parameter
 * is returned only if the task is in the completed state. The exit code for
 * a process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application
 * developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make
 * decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention
 * used by the application process. Note that the exit code may also be
 * generated by the compute node operating system, such as when a process is
 * forcibly terminated.
 * 
 * @member {object} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError]
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.category]
 * Possible values include: 'usererror', 'servererror', 'unmapped'
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.code]
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.message]
 * 
 * @member {array} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.schedulingError.details]
 * 
 * @member {number} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.retryCount]
 * 
 * @member {date} [jobPreparationTaskExecutionInfo.lastRetryTime] This
 * property is set only if the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero).
 * 
 * @member {object} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo] Information about the
 * execution status of the Job Release task on this compute node. This
 * property is set only if the Job Release task has run on the node.
 * 
 * @member {date} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.startTime]
 * 
 * @member {date} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.endTime] This property is set
 * only if the task is in the Completed state.
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.state] Possible values
 * include: 'running', 'completed'
 * 
 * @member {string} [jobReleaseTaskExecutionInfo.taskRootDirectory]
