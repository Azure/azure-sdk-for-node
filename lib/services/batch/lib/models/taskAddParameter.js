/**
 * @summary An Azure Batch Task to add.
  *
 * Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
 * Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
 * unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host
 * failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not
 * counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,
 * an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this,
 * all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.

class TaskAddParameter {
  /**
   * Create a TaskAddParameter.
   * @property {string} id A string that uniquely identifies the Task within
   * the Job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
   * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
   * characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you
   * may not have two IDs within a Job that differ only by case).
   * @property {string} [displayName] A display name for the Task. The display
   * name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a
   * maximum length of 1024.
   * @property {string} commandLine The command line of the Task. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the command line is executed as the primary Task,
   * after the primary Task and all subtasks have finished executing the
   * coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell,
   * and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
   * variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you
   * should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c
   * MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
   * line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the
   * Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container
   * under which the Task runs. If the Pool that will run this Task has
   * containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If the Pool that
   * will run this Task doesn't have containerConfiguration set, this must not
   * be set. When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node)
   * are mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped
   * into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the
   * container. Files produced in the container outside of
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning
   * that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full Image
   * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided
   * as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
   * @property {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
   * omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.workingDirectory] The default is
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include: 'taskWorkingDirectory',
   * 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {object} [exitConditions] How the Batch service should respond
   * when the Task completes.
   * @property {array} [exitConditions.exitCodes]
   * @property {array} [exitConditions.exitCodeRanges]
   * @property {object} [exitConditions.preProcessingError]
   * @property {string} [exitConditions.preProcessingError.jobAction] The
   * default is none for exit code 0 and terminate for all other exit
   * conditions. If the Job's onTaskFailed property is noaction, then
   * specifying this property returns an error and the add Task request fails
   * with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API
   * directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Possible values
   * include: 'none', 'disable', 'terminate'
   * @property {string} [exitConditions.preProcessingError.dependencyAction]
   * Possible values are 'satisfy' (allowing dependent tasks to progress) and
   * 'block' (dependent tasks continue to wait). Batch does not yet support
   * cancellation of dependent tasks. Possible values include: 'satisfy',
   * 'block'
   * @property {object} [exitConditions.fileUploadError] If the Task exited
   * with an exit code that was specified via exitCodes or exitCodeRanges, and
   * then encountered a file upload error, then the action specified by the
   * exit code takes precedence.
   * @property {string} [exitConditions.fileUploadError.jobAction] The default
   * is none for exit code 0 and terminate for all other exit conditions. If
   * the Job's onTaskFailed property is noaction, then specifying this property
   * returns an error and the add Task request fails with an invalid property
   * value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status
   * code is 400 (Bad Request). Possible values include: 'none', 'disable',
   * 'terminate'
   * @property {string} [exitConditions.fileUploadError.dependencyAction]
   * Possible values are 'satisfy' (allowing dependent tasks to progress) and
   * 'block' (dependent tasks continue to wait). Batch does not yet support
   * cancellation of dependent tasks. Possible values include: 'satisfy',
   * 'block'
   * @property {object} [exitConditions.default] This value is used if the Task
   * exits with any nonzero exit code not listed in the exitCodes or
   * exitCodeRanges collection, with a pre-processing error if the
   * preProcessingError property is not present, or with a file upload error if
   * the fileUploadError property is not present. If you want non-default
   * behavior on exit code 0, you must list it explicitly using the exitCodes
   * or exitCodeRanges collection.
   * @property {string} [exitConditions.default.jobAction] The default is none
   * for exit code 0 and terminate for all other exit conditions. If the Job's
   * onTaskFailed property is noaction, then specifying this property returns
   * an error and the add Task request fails with an invalid property value
   * error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is
   * 400 (Bad Request). Possible values include: 'none', 'disable', 'terminate'
   * @property {string} [exitConditions.default.dependencyAction] Possible
   * values are 'satisfy' (allowing dependent tasks to progress) and 'block'
   * (dependent tasks continue to wait). Batch does not yet support
   * cancellation of dependent tasks. Possible values include: 'satisfy',
   * 'block'
   * @property {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the Compute Node before running the command line. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the
   * Compute Node on which the primary Task is executed. There is a maximum
   * size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the
   * request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {array} [outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will upload from the Compute Node after running the command line. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the Compute
   * Node on which the primary Task is executed.
   * @property {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the Task.
   * @property {object} [affinityInfo] A locality hint that can be used by the
   * Batch service to select a Compute Node on which to start the new Task.
   * @property {string} [affinityInfo.affinityId] You can pass the affinityId
   * of a Node to indicate that this Task needs to run on that Compute Node.
   * Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target Compute Node is busy
   * or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then the Task will be
   * scheduled elsewhere.
   * @property {object} [constraints] The execution constraints that apply to
   * this Task. If you do not specify constraints, the maxTaskRetryCount is the
   * maxTaskRetryCount specified for the Job, the maxWallClockTime is infinite,
   * and the retentionTime is 7 days.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.maxWallClockTime] If this is not
   * specified, there is no time limit on how long the Task may run.
   * @property {moment.duration} [constraints.retentionTime] The default is 7
   * days, i.e. the Task directory will be retained for 7 days unless the
   * Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.
   * @property {number} [constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] Note that this value
   * specifically controls the number of retries for the Task executable due to
   * a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task once, and may
   * then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
   * Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the
   * maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after
   * the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {number} [requiredSlots] The number of scheduling slots that the
   * Task required to run. The default is 1. A Task can only be scheduled to
   * run on a compute node if the node has enough free scheduling slots
   * available. For multi-instance Tasks, this must be 1.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the Task
   * runs. If omitted, the Task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the
   * Task.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is
   * pool. If the pool is running Windows a value of Task should be specified
   * if stricter isolation between tasks is required. For example, if the task
   * mutates the registry in a way which could impact other tasks, or if
   * certificates have been specified on the pool which should not be
   * accessible by normal tasks but should be accessible by StartTasks.
   * Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default
   * value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {object} [multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that
   * the Task is a multi-instance Task, and contains information about how to
   * run the multi-instance Task.
   * @property {number} [multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances] If omitted,
   * the default is 1.
   * @property {string} [multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine] A
   * typical coordination command line launches a background service and
   * verifies that the service is ready to process inter-node messages.
   * @property {array} [multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] The
   * difference between common resource files and Task resource files is that
   * common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the
   * primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for the primary.
   * Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the Task working
   * directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root directory (one
   * directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the
   * list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will
   * fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
   * occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can
   * be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   * @property {object} [dependsOn] The Tasks that this Task depends on. This
   * Task will not be scheduled until all Tasks that it depends on have
   * completed successfully. If any of those Tasks fail and exhaust their retry
   * counts, this Task will never be scheduled. If the Job does not have
   * usesTaskDependencies set to true, and this element is present, the request
   * fails with error code TaskDependenciesNotSpecifiedOnJob.
   * @property {array} [dependsOn.taskIds] The taskIds collection is limited to
   * 64000 characters total (i.e. the combined length of all Task IDs). If the
   * taskIds collection exceeds the maximum length, the Add Task request fails
   * with error code TaskDependencyListTooLong. In this case consider using
   * Task ID ranges instead.
   * @property {array} [dependsOn.taskIdRanges]
   * @property {array} [applicationPackageReferences] A list of Packages that
   * the Batch service will deploy to the Compute Node before running the
   * command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared
   * directory, not the Task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced
   * package is already on the Node, and is up to date, then it is not
   * re-downloaded; the existing copy on the Compute Node is used. If a
   * referenced Package cannot be installed, for example because the package
   * has been deleted or because download failed, the Task fails.
   * @property {object} [authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
   * authentication token that the Task can use to perform Batch service
   * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task
   * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch
   * service operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is
   * provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The
   * operations that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the
   * settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add
   * other Tasks to the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks
   * under the Job.
   * @property {array} [authenticationTokenSettings.access] The authentication
   * token grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations.
   * Currently the only supported value for the access property is 'job', which
   * grants access to all operations related to the Job which contains the
   * Task.
