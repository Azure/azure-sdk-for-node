/**
 * @summary A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure
 * Batch service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.
  *
 * Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute
 * node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when
 * an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to
 * host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are
 * not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is
 * 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this,
 * all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.

class StartTask {
  /**
   * Create a StartTask.
   * @property {string} commandLine The command line of the start task. The
   * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
   * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
   * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
   * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
   * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths,
   * it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or
   * use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container
   * under which the start task runs. When this is specified, all directories
   * recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch
   * directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
   * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command
   * line is executed in the container.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full image
   * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided
   * as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
   * @property {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
   * omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the compute node before running the command line.  There
   * is a maximum size for the list of resource files. When the max size is
   * exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers. Files listed under this
   * element are located in the task's working directory.
   * @property {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the start task.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the start
   * task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique
   * to the task.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is
   * task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default
   * value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {number} [maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of times the
   * task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is
   * nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries.
   * The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this
   * limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task
   * up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count
   * is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry
   * count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [waitForSuccess] Whether the Batch service should wait
   * for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit
   * code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the
   * start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
   * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
   * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
   * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
   * condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If
   * false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In
   * this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the
   * start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks
   * will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
