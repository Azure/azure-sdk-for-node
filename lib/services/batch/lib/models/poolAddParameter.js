   * value is * which specifies the latest operating system version for the
   * specified OS family.
   * @member {string} [cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion] This may
   * differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this case
   * some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on the
   * currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
   * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
   * targetOSVersion.
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration] The virtual machine
   * configuration for the pool. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration
   * are mutually exclusive and one of the properties must be specified.

   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.version] A
   * value of 'latest' can be specified to select the latest version of an
   * image. If omitted, the default is 'latest'.
   * @member {string}
   * [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.virtualMachineImageId] This
   * property is mutually exclusive with other ImageReference properties. The
   * virtual machine image must be in the same region and subscription as the
   * Azure Batch account. For information about the firewall settings for the
   * Batch node agent to communicate with the Batch service see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk]
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.caching] Values are:
   *
   * none - The caching mode for the disk is not enabled.
   * readOnly - The caching mode for the disk is read only.
   * readWrite - The caching mode for the disk is read and write.
   *
   * The default value for caching is none. For information about the caching
   * options see:
   * https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazurestorage/2012/06/27/exploring-windows-azure-drives-disks-and-images/.
   * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSKUId] The Batch
   * node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides
   * the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service.
   * There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for
   * different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which
   * matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node
   * agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
   * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration] This
   * property must not be specified if the imageReference or osDisk property
   * specifies a Linux OS image.
   * @member {boolean}
   * [virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
   * If omitted, the default value is true.
   * @member {array} [virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks] This property must
   * be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data
   * disks attached to them. This cannot be updated.
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType] This only
   * applies to images that contain the Windows operating system, and should
   * only be used when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes which
   * will be deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is
   * applied. Values are:
   *
   * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
   * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration] If
   * specified, setup is performed on each node in the pool to allow tasks to
   * run in containers. All regular tasks and job manager tasks run on this
   * pool must specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may
   * specify it.
   * @member {array}
   * [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerImageNames]
   * This is the full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull".
   * An image will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image
   * is fully qualified with an alternative registry.
   * @member {array}
   * [virtualMachineConfiguration.containerConfiguration.containerRegistries]
   * If any images must be downloaded from a private registry which requires
   * credentials, then those credentials must be provided here.
   * @member {moment.duration} [resizeTimeout] The timeout for allocation of
   * compute nodes to the pool. This timeout applies only to manual scaling; it
   * has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15
   * minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than
   * 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST
   * API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @member {number} [targetDedicatedNodes] The desired number of dedicated
   * compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if
   * enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then
   * you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
   * @member {number} [targetLowPriorityNodes] The desired number of
   * low-priority compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be
   * specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to
   * false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes,
   * targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
   * @member {boolean} [enableAutoScale] Whether the pool size should
   * automatically adjust over time. If false, at least one of
   * targetDedicateNodes and targetLowPriorityNodes must be specified. If true,
   * the autoScaleFormula property is required and the pool automatically
   * resizes according to the formula. The default value is false.
   * @member {string} [autoScaleFormula] A formula for the desired number of
   * compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if
   * enableAutoScale is set to false. It is required if enableAutoScale is set
   * to true. The formula is checked for validity before the pool is created.
   * If the formula is not valid, the Batch service rejects the request with
   * detailed error information. For more information about specifying this
   * formula, see 'Automatically scale compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool'
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling/).
   * @member {moment.duration} [autoScaleEvaluationInterval] The time interval
   * at which to automatically adjust the pool size according to the autoscale
   * formula. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value
   * are 5 minutes and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than
   * 5 minutes or greater than 168 hours, the Batch service returns an error;
   * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
   * Request).
   * @member {boolean} [enableInterNodeCommunication] Whether the pool permits
   * direct communication between nodes. Enabling inter-node communication
   * limits the maximum size of the pool due to deployment restrictions on the
   * nodes of the pool. This may result in the pool not reaching its desired
   * size. The default value is false.
   * @member {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for the
   * pool.
   * @member {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network must
   * be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
   * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the
   * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
   * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
   * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have
   * the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   * role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication
   * from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute
   * nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any
   * associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute
   * nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service
   * will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created
   * with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
   * ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created
   * with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
   * supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security
   * Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
   * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
   * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389
   * for Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable
   * ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure
   * Storage on port 443. For more details see:
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
   * @member {object} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool
   * endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
   * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
   * @member {array}
   * [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNATPools] The maximum
   * number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum number of
   * inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status code 400.
   * @member {object} [startTask] A task specified to run on each compute node
   * as it joins the pool. The task runs when the node is added to the pool or
   * when the node is restarted.
   * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
   * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such
   * as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
   * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
   * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
   * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified, all
   * directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
   * command line is executed in the container.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the full
   * image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
   * provided as part of the image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @member {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can
   * be omitted if was already provided at pool creation.
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If
   * omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @member {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @member {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this element
   * are located in the task's working directory.
   * @member {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
   * non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] Values are:
   *
   * pool - specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which
   * is created on every node in a pool.
   * task - specifies that the service should create a new user for the task.
   * The default value is task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin
   * - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The
   * auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
   * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
   * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
   * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
   * controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once,
   * and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
   * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
   * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the task without limit.
   * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
   * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to
   * its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition
   * can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the
   * Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case,
   * other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task
   * is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
   * @member {array} [certificateReferences] The list of certificates to be
   * installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the
   * Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store
   * and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
   * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
   * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
   * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
   * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
   * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
   * @member {array} [applicationPackageReferences] The list of application
   * packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
   * @member {array} [applicationLicenses] The list of application licenses the
   * Batch service will make available on each compute node in the pool. The
   * list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
   * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported,
   * pool creation will fail.
   * @member {number} [maxTasksPerNode] The maximum number of tasks that can
   * run concurrently on a single compute node in the pool. The default value
   * is 1. The maximum value of this setting depends on the size of the compute
   * nodes in the pool (the vmSize setting).
   * @member {object} [taskSchedulingPolicy] How tasks are distributed across
   * compute nodes in a pool.
   * @member {string} [taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] Possible values
   * include: 'spread', 'pack'
   * @member {array} [userAccounts] The list of user accounts to be created on
   * each node in the pool.
   * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
   * pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to
   * metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
