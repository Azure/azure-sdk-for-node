/**

 */
class TaskInformation {
  /**
   * Create a TaskInformation.
   * @property {string} [taskUrl] The URL of the task.
   * @property {string} [jobId] The ID of the job to which the task belongs.
   * @property {string} [taskId] The ID of the task.
   * @property {number} [subtaskId] The ID of the subtask if the task is a
   * multi-instance task.
   * @property {string} taskState The current state of the task. Possible
   * values include: 'active', 'preparing', 'running', 'completed'
   * @property {object} [executionInfo] Information about the execution of the
   * task.
   * @property {date} [executionInfo.startTime] 'Running' corresponds to the
   * running state, so if the task specifies resource files or application
   * packages, then the start time reflects the time at which the task started
   * downloading or deploying these. If the task has been restarted or retried,
   * this is the most recent time at which the task started running. This
   * property is present only for tasks that are in the running or completed
   * state.
   * @property {date} [executionInfo.endTime] This property is set only if the
   * task is in the Completed state.
   * @property {number} [executionInfo.exitCode] This property is set only if
   * the task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
   * process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application
   * developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make
   * decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention
   * used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates
   * the task (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an
   * operating system-defined exit code.
   * @property {object} [executionInfo.containerInfo] This property is set only
   * if the task runs in a container context.
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.containerInfo.containerId]
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.containerInfo.state] This is the state
   * of the container according to the Docker service. It is equivalent to the
   * status field returned by "docker inspect".
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.containerInfo.error] This is the
   * detailed error string from the Docker service, if available. It is
   * equivalent to the error field returned by "docker inspect".
   * @property {object} [executionInfo.failureInfo] This property is set only
   * if the task is in the completed state and encountered a failure.
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.failureInfo.category] Possible values
   * include: 'userError', 'serverError'
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.failureInfo.code]
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.failureInfo.message]
   * @property {array} [executionInfo.failureInfo.details]
   * @property {number} [executionInfo.retryCount] Task application failures
   * (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the task could
   * not be run) and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will
   * retry the task up to the limit specified by the constraints.
   * @property {date} [executionInfo.lastRetryTime] This element is present
   * only if the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present,
   * this is typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task
   * has been restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the
   * compute node was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated
   * but the lastRetryTime is not.
   * @property {number} [executionInfo.requeueCount] When the user removes
   * nodes from a pool (by resizing/shrinking the pool) or when the job is
   * being disabled, the user can specify that running tasks on the nodes be
   * requeued for execution. This count tracks how many times the task has been
   * requeued for these reasons.
   * @property {date} [executionInfo.lastRequeueTime] This property is set only
   * if the requeueCount is nonzero.
   * @property {string} [executionInfo.result] If the value is 'failed', then
   * the details of the failure can be found in the failureInfo property.
   * Possible values include: 'success', 'failure'
