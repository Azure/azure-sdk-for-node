class VirtualMachineConfiguration {
  /**
   * Create a VirtualMachineConfiguration.
   * @member {object} imageReference A reference to the Azure Virtual Machines
   * Marketplace image or the custom Virtual Machine image to use.
   * @member {string} [imageReference.publisher] For example, Canonical or
   * MicrosoftWindowsServer.
   * @member {string} [imageReference.offer] For example, UbuntuServer or
   * WindowsServer.
   * @member {string} [imageReference.sku] For example, 14.04.0-LTS or
   * 2012-R2-Datacenter.
   * @member {string} [imageReference.version] A value of 'latest' can be
   * specified to select the latest version of an image. If omitted, the
   * default is 'latest'.
   * @member {string} [imageReference.virtualMachineImageId] This property is
   * mutually exclusive with other ImageReference properties. The virtual
   * machine image must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
   * Batch account. For information about the firewall settings for the Batch
   * node agent to communicate with the Batch service see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.
   * @member {object} [osDisk] Settings for the operating system disk of the
   * Virtual Machine.
   * @member {string} [osDisk.caching] The default value for caching is none.
   * For information about the caching options see:
   * https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazurestorage/2012/06/27/exploring-windows-azure-drives-disks-and-images/.
   * Possible values include: 'none', 'readOnly', 'readWrite'
   * @member {string} nodeAgentSKUId The SKU of the Batch node agent to be
   * provisioned on compute nodes in the pool. The Batch node agent is a
   * program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the
   * command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service.
   * There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for
   * different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which
   * matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node
   * agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
   * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
   * @member {object} [windowsConfiguration] Windows operating system settings
   * on the virtual machine. This property must not be specified if the
   * imageReference or osDisk property specifies a Linux OS image.
   * @member {boolean} [windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates] If
   * omitted, the default value is true.
   * @member {array} [dataDisks] The configuration for data disks attached to
   * the comptue nodes in the pool. This property must be specified if the
   * compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data disks attached to them.
   * This cannot be updated. Each node gets its own disk (the disk is not a
   * file share). Existing disks cannot be attached, each attached disk is
   * empty. When the node is removed from the pool, the disk and all data
   * associated with it is also deleted. The disk is not formatted after being
   * attached, it must be formatted before use - for more information see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/classic/attach-disk#initialize-a-new-data-disk-in-linux
   * and
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-disk-ps#add-an-empty-data-disk-to-a-virtual-machine.
   * @member {string} [licenseType] The type of on-premises license to be used
   * when deploying the operating system. This only applies to images that
   * contain the Windows operating system, and should only be used when you
   * hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes which will be deployed. If
   * omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is applied. Values are:
   *
   * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
   * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
   * @member {object} [containerConfiguration] The container configuration for
   * the pool. If specified, setup is performed on each node in the pool to
   * allow tasks to run in containers. All regular tasks and job manager tasks
   * run on this pool must specify the containerSettings property, and all
   * other tasks may specify it.
   * @member {array} [containerConfiguration.containerImageNames] This is the
   * full image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". An image
   * will be sourced from the default Docker registry unless the image is fully
   * qualified with an alternative registry.
   * @member {array} [containerConfiguration.containerRegistries] If any images
   * must be downloaded from a private registry which requires credentials,
   * then those credentials must be provided here.
