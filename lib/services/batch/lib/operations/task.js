/**
 * @summary Adds a Task to the specified Job.
 *
 * The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a
 * Task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated
 * by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.
 *
 * @param {string} jobId The ID of the Job to which the Task is to be added.
 *
 * @param {object} task The Task to be added.
 *
 * @param {string} task.id A string that uniquely identifies the Task within
 * the Job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
 * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
 * characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may
 * not have two IDs within a Job that differ only by case).
 *
 * @param {string} [task.displayName] A display name for the Task. The display
 * name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a
 * maximum length of 1024.
 *
 * @param {string} task.commandLine The command line of the Task. For
 * multi-instance Tasks, the command line is executed as the primary Task,
 * after the primary Task and all subtasks have finished executing the
 * coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and
 * therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
 * variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you
 * should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c
 * MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
 * line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the
 * Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
 * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
 *
 * @param {object} [task.containerSettings] The settings for the container
 * under which the Task runs. If the Pool that will run this Task has
 * containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If the Pool that will
 * run this Task doesn't have containerConfiguration set, this must not be set.
 * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
 * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
 * mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped into
 * the container, and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files
 * produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be
 * reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to
 * access those files.
 *
 * @param {string} [task.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] Additional
 * options to the container create command. These additional options are
 * supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command, in addition to those
 * controlled by the Batch Service.
 *
 * @param {string} task.containerSettings.imageName The Image to use to create
 * the container in which the Task will run. This is the full Image reference,
 * as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided as part of the
 * Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.containerSettings.registry] The private registry which
 * contains the container Image. This setting can be omitted if was already
 * provided at Pool creation.
 *
 * @param {string} [task.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] The
 * registry URL. If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
 *
 * @param {string} task.containerSettings.registry.userName The user name to
 * log into the registry server.
 *
 * @param {string} task.containerSettings.registry.password The password to log
 * into the registry server.
 *
 * @param {string} [task.containerSettings.workingDirectory] The location of
 * the container Task working directory. The default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'.
 * Possible values include: 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
 *
 * @param {object} [task.exitConditions] How the Batch service should respond
 * when the Task completes.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.exitConditions.exitCodes] A list of individual Task
 * exit codes and how the Batch service should respond to them.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.exitConditions.exitCodeRanges] A list of Task exit code
 * ranges and how the Batch service should respond to them.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.exitConditions.preProcessingError] How the Batch
 * service should respond if the Task fails to start due to an error.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.exitConditions.fileUploadError] How the Batch service
 * should respond if a file upload error occurs. If the Task exited with an
 * exit code that was specified via exitCodes or exitCodeRanges, and then
 * encountered a file upload error, then the action specified by the exit code
 * takes precedence.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.exitConditions.default] How the Batch service should
 * respond if the Task fails with an exit condition not covered by any of the
 * other properties. This value is used if the Task exits with any nonzero exit
 * code not listed in the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges collection, with a
 * pre-processing error if the preProcessingError property is not present, or
 * with a file upload error if the fileUploadError property is not present. If
 * you want non-default behavior on exit code 0, you must list it explicitly
 * using the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges collection.
 *
 * @param {string} [task.exitConditions.default.jobAction] An action to take on
 * the Job containing the Task, if the Task completes with the given exit
 * condition and the Job's onTaskFailed property is
 * 'performExitOptionsJobAction'. The default is none for exit code 0 and
 * terminate for all other exit conditions. If the Job's onTaskFailed property
 * is noaction, then specifying this property returns an error and the add Task
 * request fails with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the
 * REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Possible
 * values include: 'none', 'disable', 'terminate'
 *
 * @param {string} [task.exitConditions.default.dependencyAction] An action
 * that the Batch service performs on Tasks that depend on this Task. The
 * default is 'satisfy' for exit code 0, and 'block' for all other exit
 * conditions. If the Job's usesTaskDependencies property is set to false, then
 * specifying the dependencyAction property returns an error and the add Task
 * request fails with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the
 * REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400  (Bad Request). Possible
 * values include: 'satisfy', 'block'
 *
 * @param {array} [task.resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
 * will download to the Compute Node before running the command line. For
 * multi-instance Tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the
 * Compute Node on which the primary Task is executed. There is a maximum size
 * for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request
 * will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
 * occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be
 * achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
 * will upload from the Compute Node after running the command line. For
 * multi-instance Tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the Compute Node
 * on which the primary Task is executed.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
 * settings for the Task.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.affinityInfo] A locality hint that can be used by the
 * Batch service to select a Compute Node on which to start the new Task.
 *
 * @param {string} task.affinityInfo.affinityId An opaque string representing
 * the location of a Compute Node or a Task that has run previously. You can
 * pass the affinityId of a Node to indicate that this Task needs to run on
 * that Compute Node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target
 * Compute Node is busy or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then
 * the Task will be scheduled elsewhere.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.constraints] The execution constraints that apply to
 * this Task. If you do not specify constraints, the maxTaskRetryCount is the
 * maxTaskRetryCount specified for the Job, the maxWallClockTime is infinite,
 * and the retentionTime is 7 days.
 *
 * @param {moment.duration} [task.constraints.maxWallClockTime] The maximum
 * elapsed time that the Task may run, measured from the time the Task starts.
 * If the Task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long
 * the Task may run.
 *
 * @param {moment.duration} [task.constraints.retentionTime] The minimum time
 * to retain the Task directory on the Compute Node where it ran, from the time
 * it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the
 * Task directory and all its contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the Task
 * directory will be retained for 7 days unless the Compute Node is removed or
 * the Job is deleted.
 *
 * @param {number} [task.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of
 * times the Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit
 * code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of
 * retries for the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch
 * service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum
 * retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.userIdentity] The user identity under which the Task
 * runs. If omitted, the Task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the
 * Task.
 *
 * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.userName] The name of the user identity
 * under which the Task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are
 * mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.userIdentity.autoUser] The auto user under which the
 * Task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive;
 * you must specify one but not both.
 *
 * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The scope for the auto
 * user The default value is Task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
 *
 * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The elevation
 * level of the auto user. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
 * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
 *
 * @param {object} [task.multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that
 * the Task is a multi-instance Task, and contains information about how to run
 * the multi-instance Task.
 *
 * @param {number} [task.multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances] The number of
 * Compute Nodes required by the Task. If omitted, the default is 1.
 *
 * @param {string} task.multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine The
 * command line to run on all the Compute Nodes to enable them to coordinate
 * when the primary runs the main Task command. A typical coordination command
 * line launches a background service and verifies that the service is ready to
 * process inter-node messages.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] A list of
 * files that the Batch service will download before running the coordination
 * command line. The difference between common resource files and Task resource
 * files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks
 * including the primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for
 * the primary. Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the
 * Task working directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root
 * directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum
 * size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the
 * request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge.
 * If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size.
 * This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker
 * Containers.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.dependsOn] The Tasks that this Task depends on. This
 * Task will not be scheduled until all Tasks that it depends on have completed
 * successfully. If any of those Tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts,
 * this Task will never be scheduled. If the Job does not have
 * usesTaskDependencies set to true, and this element is present, the request
 * fails with error code TaskDependenciesNotSpecifiedOnJob.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.dependsOn.taskIds] The list of Task IDs that this Task
 * depends on. All Tasks in this list must complete successfully before the
 * dependent Task can be scheduled. The taskIds collection is limited to 64000
 * characters total (i.e. the combined length of all Task IDs). If the taskIds
 * collection exceeds the maximum length, the Add Task request fails with error
 * code TaskDependencyListTooLong. In this case consider using Task ID ranges
 * instead.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.dependsOn.taskIdRanges] The list of Task ID ranges that
 * this Task depends on. All Tasks in all ranges must complete successfully
 * before the dependent Task can be scheduled.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.applicationPackageReferences] A list of Packages that
 * the Batch service will deploy to the Compute Node before running the command
 * line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared
 * directory, not the Task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced
 * package is already on the Node, and is up to date, then it is not
 * re-downloaded; the existing copy on the Compute Node is used. If a
 * referenced Package cannot be installed, for example because the package has
 * been deleted or because download failed, the Task fails.
 *
 * @param {object} [task.authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
 * authentication token that the Task can use to perform Batch service
 * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task
 * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
 * operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided
 * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
 * that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
 * example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to
 * the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.
 *
 * @param {array} [task.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The Batch resources
 * to which the token grants access. The authentication token grants access to
 * a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently the only supported
 * value for the access property is 'job', which grants access to all
 * operations related to the Job which contains the Task.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.taskAddOptions] Additional parameters for the
 * operation
 *
 * @param {number} [options.taskAddOptions.timeout] The maximum time that the
 * server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30
 * seconds.
 *
 * @param {uuid} [options.taskAddOptions.clientRequestId] The caller-generated
 * request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly
 * braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.taskAddOptions.returnClientRequestId] Whether the
 * server should return the client-request-id in the response.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskAddOptions.ocpDate] The time the request was
 * issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock
 * time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {null} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

/**
 * @summary Adds a collection of Tasks to the specified Job.
 *
 * Note that each Task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return
 * the results for each Task in the same order the Tasks were submitted in this
 * request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during the
 * request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not at
 * all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is up
 * to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For
 * example, you should use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the
 * prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks
 * unexpectedly. If the response contains any Tasks which failed to add, a
 * client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit
 * only Tasks that failed to add, and to omit Tasks that were successfully
 * added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to
 * completion is 180 days. If a Task has not completed within 180 days of being
 * added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state
 * it was in at that time.
 *
 * @param {string} jobId The ID of the Job to which the Task collection is to
 * be added.
 *
 * @param {array} value The collection of Tasks to add. The maximum count of
 * Tasks is 100. The total serialized size of this collection must be less than
 * 1MB. If it is greater than 1MB (for example if each Task has 100's of
 * resource files or environment variables), the request will fail with code
 * 'RequestBodyTooLarge' and should be retried again with fewer Tasks.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.taskAddCollectionOptions] Additional parameters for
 * the operation
 *
 * @param {number} [options.taskAddCollectionOptions.timeout] The maximum time
 * that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is
 * 30 seconds.
 *
 * @param {uuid} [options.taskAddCollectionOptions.clientRequestId] The
 * caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration
 * such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.taskAddCollectionOptions.returnClientRequestId]
 * Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskAddCollectionOptions.ocpDate] The time the
 * request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current
 * system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API
 * directly.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.

/**
 * Updates the properties of the specified Task.
 *
 * @param {string} jobId The ID of the Job containing the Task.
 *
 * @param {string} taskId The ID of the Task to update.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.constraints] Constraints that apply to this Task.
 * If omitted, the Task is given the default constraints. For multi-instance
 * Tasks, updating the retention time applies only to the primary Task and not
 * subtasks.
 *
 * @param {moment.duration} [options.constraints.maxWallClockTime] The maximum
 * elapsed time that the Task may run, measured from the time the Task starts.
 * If the Task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
 * terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long
 * the Task may run.
 *
 * @param {moment.duration} [options.constraints.retentionTime] The minimum
 * time to retain the Task directory on the Compute Node where it ran, from the
 * time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete
 * the Task directory and all its contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the
 * Task directory will be retained for 7 days unless the Compute Node is
 * removed or the Job is deleted.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number
 * of times the Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its
 * exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number
 * of retries for the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch
 * service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
 * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times
 * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
 * service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum
 * retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.taskUpdateOptions] Additional parameters for the
 * operation
 *
 * @param {number} [options.taskUpdateOptions.timeout] The maximum time that
 * the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30
 * seconds.
 *
 * @param {uuid} [options.taskUpdateOptions.clientRequestId] The
 * caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration

 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.taskUpdateOptions.returnClientRequestId] Whether
 * the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskUpdateOptions.ocpDate] The time the request was
 * issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock
 * time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.taskUpdateOptions.ifMatch] An ETag value associated
 * with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be
 * performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches
 * the value specified by the client.

 * service does not match the value specified by the client.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskUpdateOptions.ifModifiedSince] A timestamp
 * indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The
 * operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been
 * modified since the specified time.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskUpdateOptions.ifUnmodifiedSince] A timestamp
 * indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The

/**
 * @summary Reactivates a Task, allowing it to run again even if its retry
 * count has been exhausted.
 *
 * Reactivation makes a Task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum
 * retry count. The Task's state is changed to active. As the Task is no longer
 * in the completed state, any previous exit code or failure information is no
 * longer available after reactivation. Each time a Task is reactivated, its
 * retry count is reset to 0. Reactivation will fail for Tasks that are not
 * completed or that previously completed successfully (with an exit code of
 * 0). Additionally, it will fail if the Job has completed (or is terminating
 * or deleting).
 *
 * @param {string} jobId The ID of the Job containing the Task.
 *
 * @param {string} taskId The ID of the Task to reactivate.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.taskReactivateOptions] Additional parameters for
 * the operation
 *
 * @param {number} [options.taskReactivateOptions.timeout] The maximum time
 * that the server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is
 * 30 seconds.
 *
 * @param {uuid} [options.taskReactivateOptions.clientRequestId] The
 * caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration
 * such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.taskReactivateOptions.returnClientRequestId]
 * Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskReactivateOptions.ocpDate] The time the request
 * was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock
 * time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.taskReactivateOptions.ifMatch] An ETag value
 * associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The
 * operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the
 * service exactly matches the value specified by the client.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.taskReactivateOptions.ifNoneMatch] An ETag value
 * associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The
 * operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the
 * service does not match the value specified by the client.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskReactivateOptions.ifModifiedSince] A timestamp
 * indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The
 * operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been
 * modified since the specified time.
 *
 * @param {date} [options.taskReactivateOptions.ifUnmodifiedSince] A timestamp
 * indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The
 * operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been
 * modified since the specified time.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {null} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

  /**
   * @summary Adds a Task to the specified Job.
   *
   * The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a
   * Task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated
   * by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.
   *
   * @param {string} jobId The ID of the Job to which the Task is to be added.
   *
   * @param {object} task The Task to be added.
   *
   * @param {string} task.id A string that uniquely identifies the Task within
   * the Job. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
   * including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
   * characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may
   * not have two IDs within a Job that differ only by case).
   *
   * @param {string} [task.displayName] A display name for the Task. The display
   * name need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a
   * maximum length of 1024.
   *
   * @param {string} task.commandLine The command line of the Task. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the command line is executed as the primary Task,
   * after the primary Task and all subtasks have finished executing the
   * coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and
   * therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
   * variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you
   * should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c
   * MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
   * line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the
   * Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   *
   * @param {object} [task.containerSettings] The settings for the container
   * under which the Task runs. If the Pool that will run this Task has
   * containerConfiguration set, this must be set as well. If the Pool that will
   * run this Task doesn't have containerConfiguration set, this must not be set.
   * When this is specified, all directories recursively below the
   * AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are
   * mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped into
   * the container, and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files
   * produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be
   * reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to
   * access those files.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] Additional
   * options to the container create command. These additional options are
   * supplied as arguments to the "docker create" command, in addition to those
   * controlled by the Batch Service.
   *
   * @param {string} task.containerSettings.imageName The Image to use to create
   * the container in which the Task will run. This is the full Image reference,
   * as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided as part of the
   * Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.containerSettings.registry] The private registry which
   * contains the container Image. This setting can be omitted if was already
   * provided at Pool creation.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.containerSettings.registry.registryServer] The
   * registry URL. If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   *
   * @param {string} task.containerSettings.registry.userName The user name to
   * log into the registry server.
   *
   * @param {string} task.containerSettings.registry.password The password to log
   * into the registry server.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.containerSettings.workingDirectory] The location of
   * the container Task working directory. The default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'.
   * Possible values include: 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
   *
   * @param {object} [task.exitConditions] How the Batch service should respond
   * when the Task completes.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.exitConditions.exitCodes] A list of individual Task
   * exit codes and how the Batch service should respond to them.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.exitConditions.exitCodeRanges] A list of Task exit code
   * ranges and how the Batch service should respond to them.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.exitConditions.preProcessingError] How the Batch
   * service should respond if the Task fails to start due to an error.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.exitConditions.fileUploadError] How the Batch service
   * should respond if a file upload error occurs. If the Task exited with an
   * exit code that was specified via exitCodes or exitCodeRanges, and then
   * encountered a file upload error, then the action specified by the exit code
   * takes precedence.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.exitConditions.default] How the Batch service should
   * respond if the Task fails with an exit condition not covered by any of the
   * other properties. This value is used if the Task exits with any nonzero exit
   * code not listed in the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges collection, with a
   * pre-processing error if the preProcessingError property is not present, or
   * with a file upload error if the fileUploadError property is not present. If
   * you want non-default behavior on exit code 0, you must list it explicitly
   * using the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges collection.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.exitConditions.default.jobAction] An action to take on
   * the Job containing the Task, if the Task completes with the given exit
   * condition and the Job's onTaskFailed property is
   * 'performExitOptionsJobAction'. The default is none for exit code 0 and
   * terminate for all other exit conditions. If the Job's onTaskFailed property
   * is noaction, then specifying this property returns an error and the add Task
   * request fails with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the
   * REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Possible
   * values include: 'none', 'disable', 'terminate'
   *
   * @param {string} [task.exitConditions.default.dependencyAction] An action
   * that the Batch service performs on Tasks that depend on this Task. The
   * default is 'satisfy' for exit code 0, and 'block' for all other exit
   * conditions. If the Job's usesTaskDependencies property is set to false, then
   * specifying the dependencyAction property returns an error and the add Task
   * request fails with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the
   * REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400  (Bad Request). Possible
   * values include: 'satisfy', 'block'
   *
   * @param {array} [task.resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the Compute Node before running the command line. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the
   * Compute Node on which the primary Task is executed. There is a maximum size
   * for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request
   * will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
   * occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be
   * achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will upload from the Compute Node after running the command line. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the Compute Node
   * on which the primary Task is executed.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the Task.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.affinityInfo] A locality hint that can be used by the
   * Batch service to select a Compute Node on which to start the new Task.
   *
   * @param {string} task.affinityInfo.affinityId An opaque string representing
   * the location of a Compute Node or a Task that has run previously. You can
   * pass the affinityId of a Node to indicate that this Task needs to run on
   * that Compute Node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target
   * Compute Node is busy or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then
   * the Task will be scheduled elsewhere.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.constraints] The execution constraints that apply to
   * this Task. If you do not specify constraints, the maxTaskRetryCount is the
   * maxTaskRetryCount specified for the Job, the maxWallClockTime is infinite,
   * and the retentionTime is 7 days.
   *
   * @param {moment.duration} [task.constraints.maxWallClockTime] The maximum
   * elapsed time that the Task may run, measured from the time the Task starts.
   * If the Task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
   * terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long
   * the Task may run.
   *
   * @param {moment.duration} [task.constraints.retentionTime] The minimum time
   * to retain the Task directory on the Compute Node where it ran, from the time
   * it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the
   * Task directory and all its contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the Task
   * directory will be retained for 7 days unless the Compute Node is removed or
   * the Job is deleted.
   *
   * @param {number} [task.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of
   * times the Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit
   * code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of
   * retries for the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch
   * service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
   * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times
   * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
   * service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum
   * retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.userIdentity] The user identity under which the Task
   * runs. If omitted, the Task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the
   * Task.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.userName] The name of the user identity
   * under which the Task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are
   * mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.userIdentity.autoUser] The auto user under which the
   * Task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive;
   * you must specify one but not both.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The scope for the auto
   * user The default value is Task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   *
   * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The elevation
   * level of the auto user. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
   * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   *
   * @param {object} [task.multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that
   * the Task is a multi-instance Task, and contains information about how to run
   * the multi-instance Task.
   *
   * @param {number} [task.multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances] The number of
   * Compute Nodes required by the Task. If omitted, the default is 1.
   *
   * @param {string} task.multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine The
   * command line to run on all the Compute Nodes to enable them to coordinate
   * when the primary runs the main Task command. A typical coordination command
   * line launches a background service and verifies that the service is ready to
   * process inter-node messages.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] A list of
   * files that the Batch service will download before running the coordination
   * command line. The difference between common resource files and Task resource
   * files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks
   * including the primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for
   * the primary. Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the
   * Task working directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root
   * directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum
   * size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the
   * request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge.
   * If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size.
   * This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker
   * Containers.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.dependsOn] The Tasks that this Task depends on. This
   * Task will not be scheduled until all Tasks that it depends on have completed
   * successfully. If any of those Tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts,
   * this Task will never be scheduled. If the Job does not have
   * usesTaskDependencies set to true, and this element is present, the request
   * fails with error code TaskDependenciesNotSpecifiedOnJob.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.dependsOn.taskIds] The list of Task IDs that this Task
   * depends on. All Tasks in this list must complete successfully before the
   * dependent Task can be scheduled. The taskIds collection is limited to 64000
   * characters total (i.e. the combined length of all Task IDs). If the taskIds
   * collection exceeds the maximum length, the Add Task request fails with error
   * code TaskDependencyListTooLong. In this case consider using Task ID ranges
   * instead.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.dependsOn.taskIdRanges] The list of Task ID ranges that
   * this Task depends on. All Tasks in all ranges must complete successfully
   * before the dependent Task can be scheduled.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.applicationPackageReferences] A list of Packages that
   * the Batch service will deploy to the Compute Node before running the command
   * line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared
   * directory, not the Task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced
   * package is already on the Node, and is up to date, then it is not
   * re-downloaded; the existing copy on the Compute Node is used. If a
   * referenced Package cannot be installed, for example because the package has
   * been deleted or because download failed, the Task fails.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
   * authentication token that the Task can use to perform Batch service
   * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task
   * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
   * operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided
   * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
   * that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
   * example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to
   * the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The Batch resources
   * to which the token grants access. The authentication token grants access to
   * a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently the only supported
   * value for the access property is 'job', which grants access to all
   * operations related to the Job which contains the Task.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.taskAddOptions] Additional parameters for the
   * operation
   *
   * @param {number} [options.taskAddOptions.timeout] The maximum time that the
   * server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30
   * seconds.
   *
   * @param {uuid} [options.taskAddOptions.clientRequestId] The caller-generated
   * request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly
   * braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.taskAddOptions.returnClientRequestId] Whether the
   * server should return the client-request-id in the response.
   *
   * @param {date} [options.taskAddOptions.ocpDate] The time the request was
   * issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock
   * time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<null>} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   * @reject {Error} - The error object.

   * request fails with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the
   * REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400  (Bad Request). Possible
   * values include: 'satisfy', 'block'
   *
   * @param {array} [task.resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the Compute Node before running the command line. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the
   * Compute Node on which the primary Task is executed. There is a maximum size
   * for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request
   * will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this
   * occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be
   * achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.outputFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will upload from the Compute Node after running the command line. For
   * multi-instance Tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the Compute Node
   * on which the primary Task is executed.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the Task.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.affinityInfo] A locality hint that can be used by the
   * Batch service to select a Compute Node on which to start the new Task.
   *
   * @param {string} task.affinityInfo.affinityId An opaque string representing
   * the location of a Compute Node or a Task that has run previously. You can
   * pass the affinityId of a Node to indicate that this Task needs to run on
   * that Compute Node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target
   * Compute Node is busy or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then
   * the Task will be scheduled elsewhere.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.constraints] The execution constraints that apply to
   * this Task. If you do not specify constraints, the maxTaskRetryCount is the
   * maxTaskRetryCount specified for the Job, the maxWallClockTime is infinite,
   * and the retentionTime is 7 days.
   *
   * @param {moment.duration} [task.constraints.maxWallClockTime] The maximum
   * elapsed time that the Task may run, measured from the time the Task starts.
   * If the Task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
   * terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long
   * the Task may run.
   *
   * @param {moment.duration} [task.constraints.retentionTime] The minimum time
   * to retain the Task directory on the Compute Node where it ran, from the time
   * it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the
   * Task directory and all its contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the Task
   * directory will be retained for 7 days unless the Compute Node is removed or
   * the Job is deleted.
   *
   * @param {number} [task.constraints.maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of
   * times the Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit
   * code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of
   * retries for the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch
   * service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For
   * example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times
   * (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
   * service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum
   * retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.userIdentity] The user identity under which the Task
   * runs. If omitted, the Task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the
   * Task.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.userName] The name of the user identity
   * under which the Task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are
   * mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.userIdentity.autoUser] The auto user under which the
   * Task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive;
   * you must specify one but not both.
   *
   * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The scope for the auto
   * user The default value is Task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   *
   * @param {string} [task.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The elevation
   * level of the auto user. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
   * include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   *
   * @param {object} [task.multiInstanceSettings] An object that indicates that
   * the Task is a multi-instance Task, and contains information about how to run
   * the multi-instance Task.
   *
   * @param {number} [task.multiInstanceSettings.numberOfInstances] The number of
   * Compute Nodes required by the Task. If omitted, the default is 1.
   *
   * @param {string} task.multiInstanceSettings.coordinationCommandLine The
   * command line to run on all the Compute Nodes to enable them to coordinate
   * when the primary runs the main Task command. A typical coordination command
   * line launches a background service and verifies that the service is ready to
   * process inter-node messages.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.multiInstanceSettings.commonResourceFiles] A list of
   * files that the Batch service will download before running the coordination
   * command line. The difference between common resource files and Task resource
   * files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks
   * including the primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for
   * the primary. Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the
   * Task working directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root
   * directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum
   * size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the
   * request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge.
   * If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size.
   * This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker
   * Containers.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.dependsOn] The Tasks that this Task depends on. This
   * Task will not be scheduled until all Tasks that it depends on have completed
   * successfully. If any of those Tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts,
   * this Task will never be scheduled. If the Job does not have
   * usesTaskDependencies set to true, and this element is present, the request
   * fails with error code TaskDependenciesNotSpecifiedOnJob.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.dependsOn.taskIds] The list of Task IDs that this Task
   * depends on. All Tasks in this list must complete successfully before the
   * dependent Task can be scheduled. The taskIds collection is limited to 64000
   * characters total (i.e. the combined length of all Task IDs). If the taskIds
   * collection exceeds the maximum length, the Add Task request fails with error
   * code TaskDependencyListTooLong. In this case consider using Task ID ranges
   * instead.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.dependsOn.taskIdRanges] The list of Task ID ranges that
   * this Task depends on. All Tasks in all ranges must complete successfully
   * before the dependent Task can be scheduled.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.applicationPackageReferences] A list of Packages that
   * the Batch service will deploy to the Compute Node before running the command
   * line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared
   * directory, not the Task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced
   * package is already on the Node, and is up to date, then it is not
   * re-downloaded; the existing copy on the Compute Node is used. If a
   * referenced Package cannot be installed, for example because the package has
   * been deleted or because download failed, the Task fails.
   *
   * @param {object} [task.authenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
   * authentication token that the Task can use to perform Batch service
   * operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task
   * with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
   * operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided
   * via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations
   * that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For
   * example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to
   * the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.
   *
   * @param {array} [task.authenticationTokenSettings.access] The Batch resources
   * to which the token grants access. The authentication token grants access to
   * a limited set of Batch service operations. Currently the only supported
   * value for the access property is 'job', which grants access to all
   * operations related to the Job which contains the Task.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.taskAddOptions] Additional parameters for the
   * operation
   *
   * @param {number} [options.taskAddOptions.timeout] The maximum time that the
   * server can spend processing the request, in seconds. The default is 30
   * seconds.
   *
   * @param {uuid} [options.taskAddOptions.clientRequestId] The caller-generated
   * request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly
   * braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.taskAddOptions.returnClientRequestId] Whether the
   * server should return the client-request-id in the response.
   *
   * @param {date} [options.taskAddOptions.ocpDate] The time the request was
   * issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock
   * time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @param {function} [optionalCallback] - The optional callback.
   *
   * @returns {function|Promise} If a callback was passed as the last parameter
   * then it returns the callback else returns a Promise.
   *
   * {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   *                      @resolve {null} - The deserialized result object.
