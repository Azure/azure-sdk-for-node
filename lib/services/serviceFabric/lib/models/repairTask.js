  /**
   * Create a RepairTask.
   * @member {string} taskId The ID of the repair task.
   * @member {string} [version] The version of the repair task.
   * When creating a new repair task, the version must be set to zero.  When
   * updating a repair task,
   * the version is used for optimistic concurrency checks.  If the version is
   * set to zero, the update will not check for write conflicts.  If the
   * version is set to a non-zero value, then the
   * update will only succeed if the actual current version of the repair task
   * matches this value.
   * @member {string} [description] A description of the purpose of the repair
   * task, or other informational details.
   * May be set when the repair task is created, and is immutable once set.
   * @member {string} state The workflow state of the repair task. Valid
   * initial states are Created, Claimed, and Preparing. Possible values
   * include: 'Invalid', 'Created', 'Claimed', 'Preparing', 'Approved',
   * 'Executing', 'Restoring', 'Completed'
   * @member {number} [flags] A bitwise-OR of the following values, which gives
   * additional details about the status of the repair task.
   * - 1 - Cancellation of the repair has been requested
   * - 2 - Abort of the repair has been requested
   * - 4 - Approval of the repair was forced via client request
   * @member {string} action The requested repair action. Must be specified
   * when the repair task is created, and is immutable once set.
   * @member {object} [target] The target object determines what actions the
   * system will take to prepare for the impact of the repair, prior to
   * approving execution of the repair.
   * May be set when the repair task is created, and is immutable once set.
   * @member {string} [target.kind] Polymorphic Discriminator
   * @member {string} [executor] The name of the repair executor. Must be
   * specified in Claimed and later states, and is immutable once set.
   * @member {string} [executorData] A data string that the repair executor can
   * use to store its internal state.
   * @member {object} [impact] The impact object determines what actions the
   * system will take to prepare for the impact of the repair, prior to
   * approving execution of the repair.
   * Impact must be specified by the repair executor when transitioning to the
   * Preparing state, and is immutable once set.
   * @member {string} [impact.kind] Polymorphic Discriminator
   * @member {string} [resultStatus] A value describing the overall result of
   * the repair task execution. Must be specified in the Restoring and later
   * states, and is immutable once set. Possible values include: 'Invalid',
   * 'Succeeded', 'Cancelled', 'Interrupted', 'Failed', 'Pending'
   * @member {number} [resultCode] A numeric value providing additional details
   * about the result of the repair task execution.
   * May be specified in the Restoring and later states, and is immutable once
   * set.
   * @member {string} [resultDetails] A string providing additional details
   * about the result of the repair task execution.
   * May be specified in the Restoring and later states, and is immutable once
   * set.
   * @member {object} [history] An object that contains timestamps of the
   * repair task's state transitions.
   * These timestamps are updated by the system, and cannot be directly
   * modified.
   * @member {date} [history.createdUtcTimestamp] The time when the repair task
   * entered the Created state.
   * @member {date} [history.claimedUtcTimestamp] The time when the repair task
   * entered the Claimed state.
   * @member {date} [history.preparingUtcTimestamp] The time when the repair
   * task entered the Preparing state.
   * @member {date} [history.approvedUtcTimestamp] The time when the repair
   * task entered the Approved state
   * @member {date} [history.executingUtcTimestamp] The time when the repair
   * task entered the Executing state
   * @member {date} [history.restoringUtcTimestamp] The time when the repair
   * task entered the Restoring state
   * @member {date} [history.completedUtcTimestamp] The time when the repair
   * task entered the Completed state
   * @member {date} [history.preparingHealthCheckStartUtcTimestamp] The time
   * when the repair task started the health check in the Preparing state.
   * @member {date} [history.preparingHealthCheckEndUtcTimestamp] The time when
   * the repair task completed the health check in the Preparing state.
   * @member {date} [history.restoringHealthCheckStartUtcTimestamp] The time
   * when the repair task started the health check in the Restoring state.
   * @member {date} [history.restoringHealthCheckEndUtcTimestamp] The time when
