class ApplicationUpgradeUpdateDescription {
  /**
   * Create a ApplicationUpgradeUpdateDescription.
   * @member {string} name The name of the application, including the 'fabric:'
   * URI scheme.
   * @member {string} upgradeKind The kind of upgrade out of the following
   * possible values. Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'Rolling'. Default
   * value: 'Rolling' .
   * @member {object} [applicationHealthPolicy] Defines a health policy used to
   * evaluate the health of an application or one of its children entities.
   * @member {boolean} [applicationHealthPolicy.considerWarningAsError]
   * Indicates whether warnings are treated with the same severity as errors.
   * @member {number}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyDeployedApplications] The
   * maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy deployed applications. Allowed
   * values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed
   * applications that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in
   * error.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed
   * applications over the number of nodes where the application is currently
   * deployed on in the cluster.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * nodes. Default percentage is zero.
   * @member {object} [applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy]
   * The health policy used by default to evaluate the health of a service
   * type.
   * @member {number}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyPartitionsPerService]
   * The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy partitions per service.
   * Allowed values are Byte values from zero to 100
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions
   * that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy
   * partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * partitions. Default percentage is zero.
   * @member {number}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition]
   * The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy replicas per partition.
   * Allowed values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of replicas
   * that can be unhealthy before the partition is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * replica, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy replicas
   * over the total number of replicas in the partition.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * replicas. Default percentage is zero.
   * @member {number}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyServices]
   * The maximum maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy services. Allowed
   * values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services
   * that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * service, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the
   * specific service type over the total number of services of the specific
   * service type.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * services. Default percentage is zero.
   * @member {array} [applicationHealthPolicy.serviceTypeHealthPolicyMap] The
   * map with service type health policy per service type name. The map is
   * empty by default.
   * @member {object} [updateDescription] Describes the parameters for updating
   * a rolling upgrade of application or cluster.
   * @member {string} [updateDescription.rollingUpgradeMode] The mode used to
   * monitor health during a rolling upgrade. The values are UnmonitoredAuto,
   * UnmonitoredManual, and Monitored. Possible values include: 'Invalid',
   * 'UnmonitoredAuto', 'UnmonitoredManual', 'Monitored'
   * @member {boolean} [updateDescription.forceRestart] If true, then processes
   * are forcefully restarted during upgrade even when the code version has not
   * changed (the upgrade only changes configuration or data).
   * @member {number} [updateDescription.replicaSetCheckTimeoutInMilliseconds]
   * The maximum amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and
   * prevent loss of availability when there are unexpected issues. When this
   * timeout expires, processing of the upgrade domain will proceed regardless
   * of availability loss issues. The timeout is reset at the start of each
   * upgrade domain. Valid values are between 0 and 42949672925 inclusive.
   * (unsigned 32-bit integer).
   * @member {string} [updateDescription.failureAction] The compensating action
   * to perform when a Monitored upgrade encounters monitoring policy or health
   * policy violations.
   * Invalid indicates the failure action is invalid. Rollback specifies that
   * the upgrade will start rolling back automatically.
   * Manual indicates that the upgrade will switch to UnmonitoredManual upgrade
   * mode. Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'
   * @member {string} [updateDescription.healthCheckWaitDurationInMilliseconds]
   * The amount of time to wait after completing an upgrade domain before
   * applying health policies. It is first interpreted as a string representing
   * an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number
   * representing the total number of milliseconds.
   * @member {string}
   * [updateDescription.healthCheckStableDurationInMilliseconds] The amount of
   * time that the application or cluster must remain healthy before the
   * upgrade proceeds to the next upgrade domain. It is first interpreted as a
   * string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is
   * interpreted as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
   * @member {string} [updateDescription.healthCheckRetryTimeoutInMilliseconds]
   * The amount of time to retry health evaluation when the application or
   * cluster is unhealthy before FailureAction is executed. It is first
   * interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails,
   * then it is interpreted as a number representing the total number of
   * milliseconds.
   * @member {string} [updateDescription.upgradeTimeoutInMilliseconds] The
   * amount of time the overall upgrade has to complete before FailureAction is
   * executed. It is first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601
   * duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing
   * the total number of milliseconds.
   * @member {string} [updateDescription.upgradeDomainTimeoutInMilliseconds]
   * The amount of time each upgrade domain has to complete before
   * FailureAction is executed. It is first interpreted as a string
   * representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted
   * as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
