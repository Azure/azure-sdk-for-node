   * 'Cancelled', 'ForceCancelled'
   * @member {object} [restartPartitionResult] Represents information about an
   * operation in a terminal state (Completed or Faulted).
   * @member {number} [restartPartitionResult.errorCode] If OperationState is
   * Completed, this is 0.  If OperationState is Faulted, this is an error code
   * indicating the reason.
   * @member {object} [restartPartitionResult.selectedPartition] This class
   * returns information about the partition that the user-induced operation
   * acted upon.
   * @member {string} [restartPartitionResult.selectedPartition.serviceName]
   * The name of the service the partition belongs to.
   * @member {uuid} [restartPartitionResult.selectedPartition.partitionId] An
   * internal ID used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a partition. This
   * is a randomly generated GUID when the service was created. The partition
   * ID is unique and does not change for the lifetime of the service. If the
   * same service was deleted and recreated the IDs of its partitions would be
   * different.
