   * upgrade domain. Valid values are between 0 and 42949672925 inclusive.
   * (unsigned 32-bit integer).
   * @property {boolean} [upgradeDescription.forceRestart] If true, then

   * The amount of time that the application or cluster must remain healthy
   * before the upgrade proceeds to the next upgrade domain. It is first
   * interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails,
   * then it is interpreted as a number representing the total number of
   * milliseconds.
   * @property {string}
   * [upgradeDescription.monitoringPolicy.healthCheckRetryTimeoutInMilliseconds]
   * The amount of time to retry health evaluation when the application or
   * cluster is unhealthy before FailureAction is executed. It is first
   * interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails,

   * milliseconds.
   * @property {string}
   * [upgradeDescription.monitoringPolicy.upgradeTimeoutInMilliseconds] The

   * @property {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.applicationHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyDeployedApplications]

   * values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed
   * applications that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in
   * error.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed
   * applications over the number of nodes where the application is currently
   * deployed on in the cluster.

   * nodes. Default percentage is zero.

   * Allowed values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   *

   * that can be unhealthy before the partition is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * replica, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy replicas
   * over the total number of replicas in the partition.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * replicas. Default percentage is zero.
   * @property {number}
   * [upgradeDescription.applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyServices]
   * The maximum maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy services. Allowed
   * values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services
   * that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * service, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the
   * specific service type over the total number of services of the specific
   * service type.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * services. Default percentage is zero.
   * @property {array}
   * [upgradeDescription.applicationHealthPolicy.serviceTypeHealthPolicyMap]
   * The map with service type health policy per service type name. The map is
   * empty by default.

   * upgrade started.
   * @property {string} [failureTimestampUtc] The estimated UTC datetime when
   * the upgrade failed and FailureAction was executed.
   * @property {string} [failureReason] The cause of an upgrade failure that
   * resulted in FailureAction being executed. Possible values include: 'None',
   * 'Interrupted', 'HealthCheck', 'UpgradeDomainTimeout',
   * 'OverallUpgradeTimeout'
