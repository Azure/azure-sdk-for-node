   * the following.
   * - Reserving the capacity for the services on the nodes
   * - Limiting the total number of nodes that services of this application can
   * run on
   * - Limiting the custom capacity metrics to limit the total consumption of
   * this metric by the services of this application
   * @member {number} [applicationCapacity.minimumNodes] The minimum number of
   * nodes where Service Fabric will reserve capacity for this application.
   * Note that this does not mean that the services of this application will be
   * placed on all of those nodes. If this property is set to zero, no capacity
   * will be reserved. The value of this property cannot be more than the value
   * of the MaximumNodes property.
   * @member {number} [applicationCapacity.maximumNodes] The maximum number of
   * nodes where Service Fabric will reserve capacity for this application.
   * Note that this does not mean that the services of this application will be
   * placed on all of those nodes. By default, the value of this property is
   * zero and it means that the services can be placed on any node.
   * @member {array} [applicationCapacity.applicationMetrics] List of
