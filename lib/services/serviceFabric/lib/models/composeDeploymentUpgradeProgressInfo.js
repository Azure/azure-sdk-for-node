   * 'UnmonitoredAuto' .
   * @property {boolean} [forceRestart] If true, then processes are forcefully
   * restarted during upgrade even when the code version has not changed (the
   * upgrade only changes configuration or data).
   * @property {number} [upgradeReplicaSetCheckTimeoutInSeconds] The maximum
   * amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and prevent loss
   * of availability when there are unexpected issues. When this timeout
   * expires, processing of the upgrade domain will proceed regardless of

   * health policy violations.
   * Invalid indicates the failure action is invalid. Rollback specifies that
   * the upgrade will start rolling back automatically.

   * mode. Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'
   * @property {string}
   * [monitoringPolicy.healthCheckWaitDurationInMilliseconds] The amount of
   * time to wait after completing an upgrade domain before applying health
   * policies. It is first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601
   * duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing
   * the total number of milliseconds.
   * @property {string}
   * [monitoringPolicy.healthCheckStableDurationInMilliseconds] The amount of
   * time that the application or cluster must remain healthy before the
   * upgrade proceeds to the next upgrade domain. It is first interpreted as a
   * string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is
   * interpreted as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
   * @property {string}
   * [monitoringPolicy.healthCheckRetryTimeoutInMilliseconds] The amount of
   * time to retry health evaluation when the application or cluster is
   * unhealthy before FailureAction is executed. It is first interpreted as a

   * interpreted as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
   * @property {string} [monitoringPolicy.upgradeTimeoutInMilliseconds] The
   * amount of time the overall upgrade has to complete before FailureAction is
   * executed. It is first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601
   * duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing
   * the total number of milliseconds.
   * @property {string} [monitoringPolicy.upgradeDomainTimeoutInMilliseconds]
   * The amount of time each upgrade domain has to complete before
   * FailureAction is executed. It is first interpreted as a string
   * representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted
   * as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
   * @property {object} [applicationHealthPolicy] Defines a health policy used
   * to evaluate the health of an application or one of its children entities.
   * @property {boolean} [applicationHealthPolicy.considerWarningAsError]
   * Indicates whether warnings are treated with the same severity as errors.
   * @property {number}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyDeployedApplications] The
   * maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy deployed applications. Allowed
   * values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed
   * applications that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in
   * error.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed
   * applications over the number of nodes where the application is currently
   * deployed on in the cluster.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * nodes. Default percentage is zero.
   * @property {object}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy] The health policy
   * used by default to evaluate the health of a service type.

   * The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy partitions per service.
   * Allowed values are Byte values from zero to 100
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions
   * that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy
   * partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * partitions. Default percentage is zero.
   * @property {number}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition]

   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * replica, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy replicas
   * over the total number of replicas in the partition.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * replicas. Default percentage is zero.
   * @property {number}
   * [applicationHealthPolicy.defaultServiceTypeHealthPolicy.maxPercentUnhealthyServices]
   * The maximum maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy services. Allowed
   * values are Byte values from zero to 100.
   *
   * The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services
   * that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.
   * If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
   * service, the health is evaluated as Warning.
   * This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the
   * specific service type over the total number of services of the specific
   * service type.
   * The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
   * services. Default percentage is zero.
   * @property {array} [applicationHealthPolicy.serviceTypeHealthPolicyMap] The
   * map with service type health policy per service type name. The map is
   * empty by default.
   * @property {string} [targetApplicationTypeVersion] The target application
   * type version (found in the application manifest) for the application
   * upgrade.
   * @property {string} [upgradeDuration] The estimated amount of time that the
   * overall upgrade elapsed. It is first interpreted as a string representing
   * an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number
   * representing the total number of milliseconds.
   * @property {string} [currentUpgradeDomainDuration] The estimated amount of
   * time spent processing current Upgrade Domain. It is first interpreted as a
   * string representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is
   * interpreted as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
   * @property {array} [applicationUnhealthyEvaluations] List of health
   * evaluations that resulted in the current aggregated health state.
   * @property {object} [currentUpgradeDomainProgress] Information about the
   * current in-progress upgrade domain.

   * List of upgrading nodes and their statuses
   * @property {string} [startTimestampUtc] The estimated UTC datetime when the
   * upgrade started.
   * @property {string} [failureTimestampUtc] The estimated UTC datetime when
   * the upgrade failed and FailureAction was executed.
   * @property {string} [failureReason] The cause of an upgrade failure that
   * resulted in FailureAction being executed. Possible values include: 'None',
   * 'Interrupted', 'HealthCheck', 'UpgradeDomainTimeout',
   * 'OverallUpgradeTimeout'
   * @property {object} [upgradeDomainProgressAtFailure] Information about the
   * upgrade domain progress at the time of upgrade failure.
