/**
 * @summary The Video Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
 * back a list of videos that are relevant to the search query. This section
 * provides technical details about the query parameters and headers that you
 * use to request videos and the JSON response objects that contain them. For
 * examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching the Web for
 * Videos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/search-the-web).
 *
 * @param {string} query The user's search query string. The query string
 * cannot be empty. The query string may contain [Bing Advanced
 * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
 * limit videos to a specific domain, use the
 * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. Use this
 * parameter only with the Video Search API. Do not specify this parameter when
 * calling the Trending Videos API.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
 * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
 * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
 * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
 * header and the
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
 * header, you must also specify the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
 * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
 * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
 * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
 * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
 * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
 * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * and
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
 * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
 * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
 * apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
 * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
 * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
 * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
 * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
 * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
 * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
 * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
 * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -
 * I500 Build / GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit / 533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version /
 * 4.0 Mobile Safari / 533.1. iPhone: Mozilla / 5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1
 * like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit / 536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile / 10B142

 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
 * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
 * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
 * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
 * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
 * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
 * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
 * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
 * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
 * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
 * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
 * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
 * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
 * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
 * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
 * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
 * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
 * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
 * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
 * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
 * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
 * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
 * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
 * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
 * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
 * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
 * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
 * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
 * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
 * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
 * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
 * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
 * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
 * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
 * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
 * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
 * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
 * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
 * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
 * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
 * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
 * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
 * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
 * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
 * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
 * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
 * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
 * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
 * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
 * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
 * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
 * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
 * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
 * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
 * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
 * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
 * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
 * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
 * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
 * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
 * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
 * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
 * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
 * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
 * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
 * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
 * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
 * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
 * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
 * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
 * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
 * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
 * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
 * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
 * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
 * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
 * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
 * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
 * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
 * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
 * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
 * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
 * both.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.count] The number of videos to return in the
 * response. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. The
 * default is 35. The maximum is 105. You may use this parameter along with the
 * offset parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface
 * presents 20 videos per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the
 * first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
 * example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with the Video Search API. Do
 * not specify this parameter when calling the Trending Videos API or the Web
 * Search API.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter videos by the date and time that
 * Bing discovered the video. The following are the possible filter values.
 * Day: Return videos discovered within the last 24 hours. Week: Return videos
 * discovered within the last 7 days. Month: Return videos discovered within
 * the last 30 days. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
 * [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
 * object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You
 * use this parameter to ensure that the specified video is the first video in
 * the list of videos that Bing returns.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.length] Filter videos by the following lengths:
 * Short: Return videos that are less than 5 minutes. Medium: Return videos
 * that are between 5 and 20 minutes, inclusive. Long: Return videos that are
 * longer than 20 minutes. All: Do not filter by length.Specifying this value
 * is the same as not specifying the videoLength parameter. Possible values
 * include: 'All', 'Short', 'Medium', 'Long'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
 * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
 * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
 * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
 * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
 * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
 * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
 * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
 * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
 * subject to change. This parameter and the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
 * number of videos to skip before returning videos. The default is 0. The
 * offset should be less than
 * ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-totalmatches)
 * - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results.
 * For example, if your user interface displays 20 videos per page, set count
 * to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent
 * page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for
 * multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates,
 * see
 * [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-nextoffset).
 * Use this parameter only with the Video Search API.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.pricing] Filter videos by the following pricing
 * options: Free: Return videos that are free to view. Paid: Return videos that
 * require a subscription or payment to view. All: Do not filter by
 * pricing.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the pricing
 * parameter. Possible values include: 'All', 'Free', 'Paid'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.resolution] Filter videos by the following
 * resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher resolution. HD720p:
 * Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with
 * a 1080p or higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying
 * this value is the same as not specifying the resolution parameter. Possible
 * values include: 'All', 'SD480p', 'HD720p', 'HD1080p'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
 * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
 * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
 * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
 * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
 * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
 * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
 * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
 * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
 * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
 * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
 * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
 * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
 * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
 * the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of
 * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
 * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
 * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
 * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
 * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
 * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
 * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
 * This parameter and the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
 * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
 * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
 * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
 * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
 * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
 * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
 * see the
 * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
 * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
 * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
 *
 * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
 * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
 * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
 * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
 * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
 * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
 * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
 * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
 * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
 * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
 * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *                      See {@link Videos} for more information.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

/**
 * @summary The Video Detail Search API lets you search on Bing and get back
 * insights about a video, such as related videos. This section provides
 * technical details about the query parameters and headers that you use to
 * request insights of videos and the JSON response objects that contain them.
 * For examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching the Web for
 * Videos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/search-the-web).
 *
 * @param {string} query The user's search query string. The query string
 * cannot be empty. The query string may contain [Bing Advanced
 * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
 * limit videos to a specific domain, use the
 * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. Use this
 * parameter only with the Video Search API. Do not specify this parameter when
 * calling the Trending Videos API.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
 * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
 * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
 * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
 * header and the
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
 * header, you must also specify the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
 * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
 * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
 * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
 * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
 * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
 * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * and
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
 * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
 * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
 * apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
 * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
 * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
 * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
 * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
 * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
 * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
 * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
 * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -
 * I500 Build / GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit / 533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version /
 * 4.0 Mobile Safari / 533.1. iPhone: Mozilla / 5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1
 * like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit / 536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile / 10B142
 * iPhone4; 1 BingWeb / 3.03.1428.20120423. PC: Mozilla / 5.0 (Windows NT 6.3;

 * / 7.0 Mobile / 11A465 Safari / 9537.53
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
 * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
 * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
 * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
 * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
 * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
 * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
 * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
 * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
 * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
 * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
 * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
 * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
 * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
 * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
 * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
 * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
 * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
 * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
 * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
 * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
 * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
 * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
 * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
 * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
 * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
 * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
 * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
 * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
 * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
 * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
 * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
 * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
 * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
 * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
 * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
 * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
 * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
 * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
 * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
 * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
 * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
 * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
 * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
 * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
 * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
 * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
 * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
 * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
 * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
 * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
 * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
 * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
 * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
 * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
 * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
 * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
 * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
 * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
 * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
 * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
 * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
 * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
 * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
 * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
 * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
 * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
 * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
 * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
 * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
 * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
 * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
 * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
 * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
 * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
 * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
 * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
 * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
 * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
 * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
 * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
 * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
 * both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
 * [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
 * object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You
 * use this parameter to identify the video to get insights of.
 *
 * @param {array} [options.modules] A comma-delimited list of insights to
 * request. The following are the possible case-insensitive values. All: Return
 * all available insights. RelatedVideos: Return a list of videos that are
 * similar to the video specified by the id query parameter. VideoResult:
 * Return the video that you're requesting insights of (this is the video that
 * you set the id query parameter to in your insights request). If you specify
 * an insight and there is no data for it, the response object does not include
 * the related field. For example, if you specify RelatedVideos and none exist,
 * the response does not include the relatedVideos field. Although the user's
 * query term is not required, you should always include it because it helps to
 * improve relevance and the results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
 * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
 * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
 * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
 * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
 * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
 * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
 * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
 * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
 * subject to change. This parameter and the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.resolution] Filter videos by the following
 * resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher resolution. HD720p:
 * Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with
 * a 1080p or higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying
 * this value is the same as not specifying the resolution parameter. Possible
 * values include: 'All', 'SD480p', 'HD720p', 'HD1080p'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
 * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
 * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
 * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
 * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
 * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
 * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
 * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
 * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
 * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
 * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
 * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
 * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
 * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
 * the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of
 * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
 * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
 * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
 * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
 * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
 * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
 * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
 * This parameter and the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
 * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
 * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
 * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
 * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
 * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
 * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
 * see the
 * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
 * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
 * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
 *
 * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
 * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
 * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
 * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
 * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
 * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
 * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
 * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
 * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
 * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
 * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *                      See {@link VideoDetails} for more information.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

/**
 * @summary The Video Trending Search API lets you search on Bing and get back
 * a list of videos that are trending based on search requests made by others.
 * The videos are broken out into different categories. For example, Top Music
 * Videos. For a list of markets that support trending videos, see [Trending
 * Videos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/trending-videos).
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
 * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
 * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
 * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
 * header and the
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
 * header, you must also specify the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
 * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
 * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
 * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
 * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
 * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
 * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * and
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
 * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
 * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
 * apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
 * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
 * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
 * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
 * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
 * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
 * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
 * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
 * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -
 * I500 Build / GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit / 533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version /
 * 4.0 Mobile Safari / 533.1. iPhone: Mozilla / 5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1
 * like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit / 536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile / 10B142
 * iPhone4; 1 BingWeb / 3.03.1428.20120423. PC: Mozilla / 5.0 (Windows NT 6.3;

 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
 * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
 * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
 * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
 * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
 * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
 * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
 * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
 * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
 * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
 * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
 * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
 * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
 * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
 * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
 * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
 * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
 * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
 * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
 * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
 * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
 * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
 * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
 * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
 * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
 * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
 * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
 * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
 * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
 * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
 * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
 * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
 * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
 * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
 * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
 * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
 * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
 * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
 * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
 * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
 * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
 * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
 * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
 * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
 * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
 * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
 * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
 * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
 * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
 * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
 * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
 * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
 * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
 * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
 * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
 * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
 * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
 * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
 * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
 * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
 * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
 * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
 * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
 * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
 * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
 * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
 * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
 * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
 * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
 * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
 * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
 * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
 * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
 * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
 * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
 * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
 * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
 * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
 * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
 * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
 * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
 * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
 * both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
 * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
 * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
 * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
 * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
 * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
 * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
 * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
 * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
 * subject to change. This parameter and the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
 * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
 * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
 * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
 * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
 * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
 * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
 * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
 * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
 * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
 * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
 * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
 * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
 * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
 * the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of
 * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
 * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
 * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
 * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
 * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
 * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
 * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
 * This parameter and the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
 * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
 * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
 * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
 * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
 * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
 * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
 * see the
 * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
 * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
 * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
 *
 * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
 * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
 * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
 * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
 * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
 * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
 * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
 * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
 * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
 * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
 * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *                      See {@link TrendingVideos} for more information.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

   * cannot be empty. The query string may contain [Bing Advanced
   * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
   * limit videos to a specific domain, use the
   * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. Use this
   * parameter only with the Video Search API. Do not specify this parameter when
   * calling the Trending Videos API.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
   * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
   * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
   * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
   * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
   * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
   * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
   * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * and
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
   * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
   * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
   * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
   * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
   * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
   * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC

   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
   * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
   * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
   * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
   * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
   * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
   * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
   * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
   * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
   * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
   * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
   * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
   * both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.count] The number of videos to return in the
   * response. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. The
   * default is 35. The maximum is 105. You may use this parameter along with the
   * offset parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface
   * presents 20 videos per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the
   * first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
   * example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with the Video Search API. Do
   * not specify this parameter when calling the Trending Videos API or the Web
   * Search API.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter videos by the date and time that
   * Bing discovered the video. The following are the possible filter values.
   * Day: Return videos discovered within the last 24 hours. Week: Return videos
   * discovered within the last 7 days. Month: Return videos discovered within
   * the last 30 days. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
   * [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
   * object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You
   * use this parameter to ensure that the specified video is the first video in
   * the list of videos that Bing returns.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.length] Filter videos by the following lengths:
   * Short: Return videos that are less than 5 minutes. Medium: Return videos
   * that are between 5 and 20 minutes, inclusive. Long: Return videos that are
   * longer than 20 minutes. All: Do not filter by length.Specifying this value
   * is the same as not specifying the videoLength parameter. Possible values
   * include: 'All', 'Short', 'Medium', 'Long'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
   * number of videos to skip before returning videos. The default is 0. The
   * offset should be less than
   * ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-totalmatches)
   * - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results.
   * For example, if your user interface displays 20 videos per page, set count
   * to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent
   * page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for
   * multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates,
   * see
   * [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-nextoffset).
   * Use this parameter only with the Video Search API.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.pricing] Filter videos by the following pricing
   * options: Free: Return videos that are free to view. Paid: Return videos that
   * require a subscription or payment to view. All: Do not filter by
   * pricing.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the pricing
   * parameter. Possible values include: 'All', 'Free', 'Paid'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.resolution] Filter videos by the following
   * resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher resolution. HD720p:
   * Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with
   * a 1080p or higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying
   * this value is the same as not specifying the resolution parameter. Possible
   * values include: 'All', 'SD480p', 'HD720p', 'HD1080p'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
   * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
   * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
   * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
   * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
   * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
   * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
   * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
   * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
   * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
   * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
   * the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of
   * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
   * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
   * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
   * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
   * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
   * see the
   * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
   * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
   * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
   *
   * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
   * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
   * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
   * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
   * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
   * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
   * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
   * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
   * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
   * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
   * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<Videos>} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   * @reject {Error} - The error object.

   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
   * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
   * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
   * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
   * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
   * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
   * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
   * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
   * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
   * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
   * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
   * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
   * both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.count] The number of videos to return in the
   * response. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. The
   * default is 35. The maximum is 105. You may use this parameter along with the
   * offset parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface
   * presents 20 videos per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the
   * first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
   * example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with the Video Search API. Do
   * not specify this parameter when calling the Trending Videos API or the Web
   * Search API.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter videos by the date and time that
   * Bing discovered the video. The following are the possible filter values.
   * Day: Return videos discovered within the last 24 hours. Week: Return videos
   * discovered within the last 7 days. Month: Return videos discovered within
   * the last 30 days. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
   * [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
   * object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You
   * use this parameter to ensure that the specified video is the first video in
   * the list of videos that Bing returns.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.length] Filter videos by the following lengths:
   * Short: Return videos that are less than 5 minutes. Medium: Return videos
   * that are between 5 and 20 minutes, inclusive. Long: Return videos that are
   * longer than 20 minutes. All: Do not filter by length.Specifying this value
   * is the same as not specifying the videoLength parameter. Possible values
   * include: 'All', 'Short', 'Medium', 'Long'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
   * number of videos to skip before returning videos. The default is 0. The
   * offset should be less than
   * ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-totalmatches)
   * - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results.
   * For example, if your user interface displays 20 videos per page, set count
   * to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent
   * page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for
   * multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates,
   * see
   * [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-nextoffset).
   * Use this parameter only with the Video Search API.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.pricing] Filter videos by the following pricing
   * options: Free: Return videos that are free to view. Paid: Return videos that
   * require a subscription or payment to view. All: Do not filter by
   * pricing.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the pricing
   * parameter. Possible values include: 'All', 'Free', 'Paid'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.resolution] Filter videos by the following
   * resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher resolution. HD720p:
   * Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with
   * a 1080p or higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying
   * this value is the same as not specifying the resolution parameter. Possible
   * values include: 'All', 'SD480p', 'HD720p', 'HD1080p'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
   * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
   * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
   * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
   * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
   * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
   * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
   * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
   * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
   * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
   * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
   * the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of
   * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
   * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
   * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
   * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
   * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
   * see the
   * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
   * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
   * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
   *
   * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
   * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
   * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
   * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
   * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
   * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
   * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
   * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
   * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
   * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
   * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @param {function} [optionalCallback] - The optional callback.
   *
   * @returns {function|Promise} If a callback was passed as the last parameter
   * then it returns the callback else returns a Promise.
   *
   * {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   *                      @resolve {Videos} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   *                      @reject {Error} - The error object.
   *
   * {function} optionalCallback(err, result, request, response)
   *
   *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
   *
   *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
   *                      See {@link Videos} for more information.
   *
   *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
   *
   *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

  /**
   * @summary The Video Detail Search API lets you search on Bing and get back
   * insights about a video, such as related videos. This section provides
   * technical details about the query parameters and headers that you use to
   * request insights of videos and the JSON response objects that contain them.
   * For examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching the Web for
   * Videos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/search-the-web).
   *
   * @param {string} query The user's search query string. The query string
   * cannot be empty. The query string may contain [Bing Advanced
   * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
   * limit videos to a specific domain, use the
   * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. Use this
   * parameter only with the Video Search API. Do not specify this parameter when
   * calling the Trending Videos API.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
   * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
   * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
   * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
   * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
   * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
   * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
   * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * and
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
   * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
   * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
   * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
   * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
   * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
   * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
   * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
   * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
   * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
   * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -

   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
   * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
   * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
   * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
   * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
   * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
   * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
   * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
   * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
   * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
   * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
   * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
   * both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
   * [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
   * object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You
   * use this parameter to identify the video to get insights of.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.modules] A comma-delimited list of insights to
   * request. The following are the possible case-insensitive values. All: Return
   * all available insights. RelatedVideos: Return a list of videos that are
   * similar to the video specified by the id query parameter. VideoResult:
   * Return the video that you're requesting insights of (this is the video that
   * you set the id query parameter to in your insights request). If you specify
   * an insight and there is no data for it, the response object does not include
   * the related field. For example, if you specify RelatedVideos and none exist,
   * the response does not include the relatedVideos field. Although the user's
   * query term is not required, you should always include it because it helps to
   * improve relevance and the results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and

   *
   * @param {string} [options.resolution] Filter videos by the following
   * resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher resolution. HD720p:
   * Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with
   * a 1080p or higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying
   * this value is the same as not specifying the resolution parameter. Possible
   * values include: 'All', 'SD480p', 'HD720p', 'HD1080p'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
   * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
   * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
   * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
   * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
   * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
   * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
   * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
   * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
   * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
   * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what

   * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
   * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
   * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
   * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
   * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
   * see the
   * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
   * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
   * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
   *
   * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
   * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
   * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
   * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
   * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
   * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
   * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
   * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
   * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
   * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
   * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<VideoDetails>} - The deserialized result object.

   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or

   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses

   * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
   * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
   * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
   * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt)

   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
   * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
   * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
   * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
   * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
   * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
   * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
   * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
   * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
   * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
   * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
   * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
   * both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
   * [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
   * object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You
   * use this parameter to identify the video to get insights of.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.modules] A comma-delimited list of insights to
   * request. The following are the possible case-insensitive values. All: Return
   * all available insights. RelatedVideos: Return a list of videos that are
   * similar to the video specified by the id query parameter. VideoResult:
   * Return the video that you're requesting insights of (this is the video that
   * you set the id query parameter to in your insights request). If you specify
   * an insight and there is no data for it, the response object does not include
   * the related field. For example, if you specify RelatedVideos and none exist,
   * the response does not include the relatedVideos field. Although the user's
   * query term is not required, you should always include it because it helps to
   * improve relevance and the results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.resolution] Filter videos by the following
   * resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher resolution. HD720p:
   * Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with
   * a 1080p or higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying
   * this value is the same as not specifying the resolution parameter. Possible
   * values include: 'All', 'SD480p', 'HD720p', 'HD1080p'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
   * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
   * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
   * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
   * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
   * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
   * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
   * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
   * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
   * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
   * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
   * the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of
   * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
   * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
   * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
   * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
   * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
   * see the
   * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
   * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
   * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
   *
   * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
   * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
   * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
   * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
   * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
   * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special

   * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
   * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @param {function} [optionalCallback] - The optional callback.
   *

   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
   * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
   * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
   * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
   * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
   * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
   * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
   * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
   * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
   * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
   * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
   * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
   * both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter videos for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail
   * images of the videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the
   * Web Search API, the response includes adult videos but the thumbnail images
   * of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content.
   * If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include
   * videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
   * pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The
   * default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
   * policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
   * safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there
   * is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what
   * the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of
   * the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
   * content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
   * whether display strings contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting
   * characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false.
   * To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers,
   * see the
   * [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
   * query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
   * Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
   *
   * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
   * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
   * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
   * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
   * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
   * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
   * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
   * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
   * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
   * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
   * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<TrendingVideos>} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   * @reject {Error} - The error object.

  /**
   * @summary The Video Trending Search API lets you search on Bing and get back

   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or

   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses

   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
