/**
 * @summary The Web Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
 * back search results that include links to webpages, images, and more.
 *
 * @param {string} query The user's search query term. The term may not be
 * empty. The term may contain Bing Advanced Operators. For example, to limit
 * results to a specific domain, use the site: operator.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
 * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
 * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
 * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
 * header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not
 * specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc query
 * parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from the
 * list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to determine the
 * market to return results for. If the list does not include a supported
 * language, Bing will find the closest language and market that supports the
 * request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results instead
 * of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query parameter
 * only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt
 * and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's
 * used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user interface
 * strings in the JSON response objects. Any links in the response objects to
 * Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.pragma] By default, Bing returns cached content, if
 * available. To prevent Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma
 * header to no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).
 *
 * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
 * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
 * experience. Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify
 * this header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
 * browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC
 * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
 * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
 * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
 * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
 * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
 * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
 * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
 * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
 * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
 * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
 * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
 * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
 * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
 * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
 * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
 * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
 * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
 * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
 * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
 * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
 * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
 * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
 * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
 * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
 * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
 * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
 * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
 * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
 * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
 * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
 * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
 * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
 * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
 * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
 * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
 * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
 * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
 * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
 * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
 * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
 * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
 * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
 * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
 * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
 * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
 * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
 * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
 * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
 * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
 * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
 * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
 * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
 * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
 * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
 * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
 * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
 * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
 * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
 * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
 * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
 * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
 * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
 * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
 * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
 * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
 * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
 * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
 * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
 * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
 * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.answerCount] The number of answers that you want
 * the response to include. The answers that Bing returns are based on ranking.
 * For example, if Bing returns webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches
 * for a request and you set this parameter to two (2), the response includes
 * webpages and images.If you included the responseFilter query parameter in
 * the same request and set it to webpages and news, the response would include
 * only webpages.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
 * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
 * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
 * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
 * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
 * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
 * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
 * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
 * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
 * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
 * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
 * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
 * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
 * both.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.count] The number of search results to return in
 * the response. The default is 10 and the maximum value is 50. The actual
 * number delivered may be less than requested.Use this parameter along with
 * the offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
 * displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get
 * the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 10
 * (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for multiple pages to include some
 * overlap in results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter search results by the following
 * age values: Day—Return webpages that Bing discovered within the last 24
 * hours. Week—Return webpages that Bing discovered within the last 7 days.
 * Month—Return webpages that discovered within the last 30 days. This filter
 * applies only to webpage results and not to the other results such as news
 * and images. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
 * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
 * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
 * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
 * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
 * insensitive. If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market.
 * Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate
 * and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in Market
 * Codes, Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
 * subject to change. This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually
 * exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
 * number of search results to skip before returning results. The default is 0.
 * The offset should be less than (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this
 * parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For example, if
 * your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and
 * offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page,
 * increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for multiple
 * pages to include some overlap in results.
 *
 * @param {array} [options.promote] A comma-delimited list of answers that you
 * want the response to include regardless of their ranking. For example, if
 * you set answerCount) to two (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked answers,
 * but you also want the response to include news, you'd set promote to news.
 * If the top ranked answers are webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches,
 * the response includes webpages and images because news is not a ranked
 * answer. But if you set promote to video, Bing would promote the video answer
 * into the response and return webpages, images, and videos. The answers that
 * you want to promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For example,
 * if the ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set answerCount
 * to 1 and promote to news, the response contains news and images. Or, if the
 * ranked answers are videos, images, and news, the response contains videos
 * and news. Possible values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches,
 * SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you specify
 * answerCount.
 *
 * @param {array} [options.responseFilter] A comma-delimited list of answers to
 * include in the response. If you do not specify this parameter, the response
 * includes all search answers for which there's relevant data. Possible filter
 * values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions,
 * TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Although you may use this filter to get a single
 * answer, you should instead use the answer-specific endpoint in order to get
 * richer results. For example, to receive only images, send the request to one
 * of the Image Search API endpoints. The RelatedSearches and SpellSuggestions
 * answers do not support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API does
 * (only the Web Search API returns them). To include answers that would
 * otherwise be excluded because of ranking, see the promote query parameter.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] A filter used to filter adult content.
 * Off: Return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return
 * webpages with adult text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not
 * return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is Moderate.
 * If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
 * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
 * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
 * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
 * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
 * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
 * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
 * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
 * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
 * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
 * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
 * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
 * This parameter and the Accept-Language header are mutually exclusive; do not
 * specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in
 * a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response
 * objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
 * apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
 * whether display strings should contain decoration markers such as hit
 * highlighting characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The
 * default is false. To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags
 * as the markers, see the textFormat query parameter.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
 * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
 * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
 * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
 * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
 * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
 * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
 * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
 * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
 * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
 * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *                      See {@link SearchResponse} for more information.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

  /**
   * @summary The Web Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
   * back search results that include links to webpages, images, and more.
   *
   * @param {string} query The user's search query term. The term may not be
   * empty. The term may contain Bing Advanced Operators. For example, to limit
   * results to a specific domain, use the site: operator.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
   * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not
   * specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc query
   * parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from the
   * list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to determine the
   * market to return results for. If the list does not include a supported
   * language, Bing will find the closest language and market that supports the
   * request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results instead
   * of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query parameter
   * only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt
   * and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's
   * used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user interface
   * strings in the JSON response objects. Any links in the response objects to
   * Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.pragma] By default, Bing returns cached content, if
   * available. To prevent Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma
   * header to no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).
   *
   * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
   * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
   * experience. Although optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify
   * this header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
   * browser would send. For information about user agents, see [RFC
   * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.answerCount] The number of answers that you want
   * the response to include. The answers that Bing returns are based on ranking.
   * For example, if Bing returns webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches
   * for a request and you set this parameter to two (2), the response includes
   * webpages and images.If you included the responseFilter query parameter in
   * the same request and set it to webpages and news, the response would include
   * only webpages.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
   * States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If
   * you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header.
   * Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and
   * combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine
   * the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a
   * supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports
   * the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
   * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
   * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
   * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
   * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
   * both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.count] The number of search results to return in
   * the response. The default is 10 and the maximum value is 50. The actual
   * number delivered may be less than requested.Use this parameter along with
   * the offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
   * displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get
   * the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 10
   * (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for multiple pages to include some
   * overlap in results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter search results by the following
   * age values: Day—Return webpages that Bing discovered within the last 24
   * hours. Week—Return webpages that Bing discovered within the last 7 days.
   * Month—Return webpages that discovered within the last 30 days. This filter
   * applies only to webpage results and not to the other results such as news
   * and images. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market.
   * Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate
   * and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in Market
   * Codes, Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually
   * exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
   * number of search results to skip before returning results. The default is 0.
   * The offset should be less than (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this
   * parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For example, if
   * your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and
   * offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page,
   * increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for multiple
   * pages to include some overlap in results.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.promote] A comma-delimited list of answers that you
   * want the response to include regardless of their ranking. For example, if
   * you set answerCount) to two (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked answers,
   * but you also want the response to include news, you'd set promote to news.
   * If the top ranked answers are webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches,
   * the response includes webpages and images because news is not a ranked
   * answer. But if you set promote to video, Bing would promote the video answer
   * into the response and return webpages, images, and videos. The answers that
   * you want to promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For example,
   * if the ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set answerCount
   * to 1 and promote to news, the response contains news and images. Or, if the
   * ranked answers are videos, images, and news, the response contains videos
   * and news. Possible values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches,
   * SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you specify
   * answerCount.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.responseFilter] A comma-delimited list of answers to
   * include in the response. If you do not specify this parameter, the response
   * includes all search answers for which there's relevant data. Possible filter
   * values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions,
   * TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Although you may use this filter to get a single
   * answer, you should instead use the answer-specific endpoint in order to get
   * richer results. For example, to receive only images, send the request to one
   * of the Image Search API endpoints. The RelatedSearches and SpellSuggestions
   * answers do not support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API does
   * (only the Web Search API returns them). To include answers that would
   * otherwise be excluded because of ranking, see the promote query parameter.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] A filter used to filter adult content.
   * Off: Return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return
   * webpages with adult text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not
   * return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is Moderate.
   * If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
   * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
   * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
   * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
   * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
   * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
   * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the Accept-Language header are mutually exclusive; do not
   * specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in
   * a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response
   * objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
   * whether display strings should contain decoration markers such as hit
   * highlighting characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The
   * default is false. To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags
   * as the markers, see the textFormat query parameter.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
   * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
   * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
   * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
   * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
   * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
   * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
   * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
   * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
   * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
   * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<SearchResponse>} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   * @reject {Error} - The error object.

   * The offset should be less than (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this
   * parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For example, if
   * your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and
   * offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page,
   * increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for multiple
   * pages to include some overlap in results.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.promote] A comma-delimited list of answers that you
   * want the response to include regardless of their ranking. For example, if
   * you set answerCount) to two (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked answers,
   * but you also want the response to include news, you'd set promote to news.
   * If the top ranked answers are webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches,
   * the response includes webpages and images because news is not a ranked
   * answer. But if you set promote to video, Bing would promote the video answer
   * into the response and return webpages, images, and videos. The answers that
   * you want to promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For example,
   * if the ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set answerCount
   * to 1 and promote to news, the response contains news and images. Or, if the
   * ranked answers are videos, images, and news, the response contains videos
   * and news. Possible values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches,
   * SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you specify
   * answerCount.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.responseFilter] A comma-delimited list of answers to
   * include in the response. If you do not specify this parameter, the response
   * includes all search answers for which there's relevant data. Possible filter
   * values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions,
   * TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Although you may use this filter to get a single
   * answer, you should instead use the answer-specific endpoint in order to get
   * richer results. For example, to receive only images, send the request to one
   * of the Image Search API endpoints. The RelatedSearches and SpellSuggestions
   * answers do not support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API does
   * (only the Web Search API returns them). To include answers that would
   * otherwise be excluded because of ranking, see the promote query parameter.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] A filter used to filter adult content.
   * Off: Return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return
   * webpages with adult text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not
   * return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is Moderate.
   * If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
   * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
   * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
   * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
   * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
   * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
   * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the Accept-Language header are mutually exclusive; do not
   * specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in
   * a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response
   * objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [options.textDecorations] A Boolean value that determines
   * whether display strings should contain decoration markers such as hit
   * highlighting characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The
   * default is false. To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags
   * as the markers, see the textFormat query parameter.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.textFormat] The type of markers to use for text
   * decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are
   * Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
   * The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing
   * uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit
   * highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
   * formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display
   * strings. The default is Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML
   * characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes
   * the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;). Possible
   * values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @param {function} [optionalCallback] - The optional callback.
   *
   * @returns {function|Promise} If a callback was passed as the last parameter
   * then it returns the callback else returns a Promise.
   *
   * {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   *                      @resolve {SearchResponse} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   *                      @reject {Error} - The error object.
   *
   * {function} optionalCallback(err, result, request, response)
   *
   *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
   *
   *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
   *                      See {@link SearchResponse} for more information.
   *
   *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
   *
   *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.
