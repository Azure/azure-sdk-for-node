   * @property {string} [target.digest] The digest of the content, as defined
   * by the Registry V2 HTTP API Specification.
   * @property {number} [target.length] The number of bytes of the content.
   * Same as Size field.

   * @property {string} [request.id] The ID of the request that initiated the
   * event.
   * @property {string} [request.addr] The IP or hostname and possibly port of

   * requests.

   * @property {string} [actor.name] The subject or username associated with
   * the request context that generated the event.
   * @property {object} [source] The registry node that generated the event.
   * Put differently, while the actor initiates the event, the source generates
   * it.
   * @property {string} [source.addr] The IP or hostname and the port of the
   * registry node that generated the event. Generally, this will be resolved
   * by os.Hostname() along with the running port.
   * @property {string} [source.instanceID] The running instance of an
   * application. Changes after each restart.
