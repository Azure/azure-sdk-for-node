   * @member {string} [description] Product description. May include HTML
   * formatting tags.
   * @member {string} [terms] Product terms of use. Developers trying to
   * subscribe to the product will be presented and required to accept these
   * terms before they can complete the subscription process.
   * @member {boolean} [subscriptionRequired] Whether a product subscription is
   * required for accessing APIs included in this product. If true, the product
   * is referred to as "protected" and a valid subscription key is required for
   * a request to an API included in the product to succeed. If false, the
   * product is referred to as "open" and requests to an API included in the
   * product can be made without a subscription key. If property is omitted
   * when creating a new product it's value is assumed to be true.
   * @member {boolean} [approvalRequired] whether subscription approval is
   * required. If false, new subscriptions will be approved automatically
   * enabling developers to call the product’s APIs immediately after
   * subscribing. If true, administrators must manually approve the
   * subscription before the developer can any of the product’s APIs. Can be
   * present only if subscriptionRequired property is present and has a value
   * of false.
   * @member {number} [subscriptionsLimit] Whether the number of subscriptions
   * a user can have to this product at the same time. Set to null or omit to
   * allow unlimited per user subscriptions. Can be present only if
   * subscriptionRequired property is present and has a value of false.
   * @member {string} [state] whether product is published or not. Published
   * products are discoverable by users of developer portal. Non published
   * products are visible only to administrators. Default state of Product is
   * notPublished. Possible values include: 'notPublished', 'published'
