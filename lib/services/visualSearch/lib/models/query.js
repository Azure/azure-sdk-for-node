   * search results page for the query.
   * @member {string} [searchLink] The URL that you use to get the results of

   * Otherwise, use the webSearchUrl URL.
   * @member {object} [thumbnail] The URL to a thumbnail of a related image.
   * @member {object} [thumbnail.thumbnail] The URL to a thumbnail of the
   * image.
   * @member {string} [thumbnail.imageInsightsToken] The token that you use in

   * of the number of websites where you can buy an apple pie. To indicate the
   * number of offers in your UX, include badging such as a shopping cart icon
   * that contains the count. When the user clicks on the icon, use
   * imageInisghtsToken in a subsequent Visual Search API call to get the list
   * of shopping websites.

   * number of websites that sell the products seen in the image.

   * AggregateRating, OfferCount, and LowPrice.
   * @member {array} [thumbnail.insightsMetadata.aggregateOffer.offers] A list
   * of offers from merchants that have offerings related to the image.
