 * The parameters that can be provided when updating the storage account
 * properties.
 *
 * @member {object} [sku] Gets or sets the SKU name. Note that the SKU name
 * cannot be updated to Standard_ZRS or Premium_LRS, nor can accounts of those
 * sku names be updated to any other value.

 * creation; optional for update. Note that in older versions, sku name was
 * called accountType. Possible values include: 'Standard_LRS', 'Standard_GRS',
 * 'Standard_RAGRS', 'Standard_ZRS', 'Premium_LRS'
 *
 * @member {string} [sku.tier] Gets the sku tier. This is based on the SKU
 * name. Possible values include: 'Standard', 'Premium'
 *
 * @member {object} [tags] Gets or sets a list of key value pairs that describe
 * the resource. These tags can be used in viewing and grouping this resource
 * (across resource groups). A maximum of 15 tags can be provided for a
 * resource. Each tag must have a key no greater in length than 128 characters
 * and a value no greater in length than 256 characters.
 *
 * @member {object} [customDomain] Custom domain assigned to the storage
 * account by the user. Name is the CNAME source. Only one custom domain is
 * supported per storage account at this time. To clear the existing custom
 * domain, use an empty string for the custom domain name property.
 *
 * @member {string} [customDomain.name] Gets or sets the custom domain name
 * assigned to the storage account. Name is the CNAME source.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [customDomain.useSubDomain] Indicates whether indirect
 * CName validation is enabled. Default value is false. This should only be set
 * on updates.

 * @member {object} [encryption] Provides the encryption settings on the
 * account. The default setting is unencrypted.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services] List of services which support
 * encryption.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services.blob] The encryption function of the
 * blob storage service.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [encryption.services.blob.enabled] A boolean indicating
 * whether or not the service encrypts the data as it is stored.
 *
 * @member {date} [encryption.services.blob.lastEnabledTime] Gets a rough
 * estimate of the date/time when the encryption was last enabled by the user.
 * Only returned when encryption is enabled. There might be some unencrypted
 * blobs which were written after this time, as it is just a rough estimate.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services.file] The encryption function of the
 * file storage service.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [encryption.services.file.enabled] A boolean indicating
