/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the StorageAccountCreateParameters class.
 * @constructor
 * The parameters used when creating a storage account.
 *
 * @member {object} sku Required. Gets or sets the sku name.
 *
 * @member {string} [sku.name] Gets or sets the sku name. Required for account
 * creation; optional for update. Note that in older versions, sku name was
 * called accountType. Possible values include: 'Standard_LRS', 'Standard_GRS',
 * 'Standard_RAGRS', 'Standard_ZRS', 'Premium_LRS'
 *
 * @member {string} [sku.tier] Gets the sku tier. This is based on the SKU
 * name. Possible values include: 'Standard', 'Premium'
 *
 * @member {string} kind Required. Indicates the type of storage account.
 * Possible values include: 'Storage', 'BlobStorage'
 *
 * @member {string} location Required. Gets or sets the location of the
 * resource. This will be one of the supported and registered Azure Geo Regions
 * (e.g. West US, East US, Southeast Asia, etc.). The geo region of a resource
 * cannot be changed once it is created, but if an identical geo region is
 * specified on update, the request will succeed.
 *
 * @member {object} [tags] Gets or sets a list of key value pairs that describe
 * the resource. These tags can be used for viewing and grouping this resource
 * (across resource groups). A maximum of 15 tags can be provided for a
 * resource. Each tag must have a key with a length no greater than 128
 * characters and a value with a length no greater than 256 characters.
 *
 * @member {object} [customDomain] User domain assigned to the storage account.
 * Name is the CNAME source. Only one custom domain is supported per storage
 * account at this time. To clear the existing custom domain, use an empty
 * string for the custom domain name property.
 *
 * @member {string} [customDomain.name] Gets or sets the custom domain name
 * assigned to the storage account. Name is the CNAME source.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [customDomain.useSubDomain] Indicates whether indirect
 * CName validation is enabled. Default value is false. This should only be set
 * on updates.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption] Provides the encryption settings on the
 * account. If left unspecified the account encryption settings will remain the
 * same. The default setting is unencrypted.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services] List of services which support
 * encryption.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services.blob] The encryption function of the
 * blob storage service.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [encryption.services.blob.enabled] A boolean indicating
 * whether or not the service encrypts the data as it is stored.
 *
 * @member {date} [encryption.services.blob.lastEnabledTime] Gets a rough
 * estimate of the date/time when the encryption was last enabled by the user.
 * Only returned when encryption is enabled. There might be some unencrypted
 * blobs which were written after this time, as it is just a rough estimate.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services.file] The encryption function of the
 * file storage service.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [encryption.services.file.enabled] A boolean indicating
 * whether or not the service encrypts the data as it is stored.
 *
 * @member {date} [encryption.services.file.lastEnabledTime] Gets a rough
 * estimate of the date/time when the encryption was last enabled by the user.
 * Only returned when encryption is enabled. There might be some unencrypted
 * blobs which were written after this time, as it is just a rough estimate.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services.table] The encryption function of the
 * table storage service.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [encryption.services.table.enabled] A boolean indicating
 * whether or not the service encrypts the data as it is stored.
 *
 * @member {date} [encryption.services.table.lastEnabledTime] Gets a rough
 * estimate of the date/time when the encryption was last enabled by the user.
 * Only returned when encryption is enabled. There might be some unencrypted
 * blobs which were written after this time, as it is just a rough estimate.
 *
 * @member {object} [encryption.services.queue] The encryption function of the
 * queue storage service.
 *
 * @member {boolean} [encryption.services.queue.enabled] A boolean indicating
 * whether or not the service encrypts the data as it is stored.
 *
 * @member {date} [encryption.services.queue.lastEnabledTime] Gets a rough
 * estimate of the date/time when the encryption was last enabled by the user.
 * Only returned when encryption is enabled. There might be some unencrypted
 * blobs which were written after this time, as it is just a rough estimate.
 *
 * @member {string} [accessTier] Required for storage accounts where kind =
 * BlobStorage. The access tier used for billing. Possible values include:
 * 'Hot', 'Cool'
 *
