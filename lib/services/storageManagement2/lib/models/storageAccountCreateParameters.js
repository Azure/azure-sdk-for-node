   * @member {object} sku Required. Gets or sets the sku name.
   * @member {string} [sku.name] Gets or sets the sku name. Required for
   * account creation; optional for update. Note that in older versions, sku
   * name was called accountType. Possible values include: 'Standard_LRS',
   * 'Standard_GRS', 'Standard_RAGRS', 'Standard_ZRS', 'Premium_LRS'
   * @member {string} [sku.tier] Gets the sku tier. This is based on the SKU
   * name. Possible values include: 'Standard', 'Premium'
   * @member {string} [sku.resourceType] The type of the resource, usually it
   * is 'storageAccounts'.
   * @member {string} [sku.kind] Indicates the type of storage account.
   * Possible values include: 'Storage', 'StorageV2', 'BlobStorage'
   * @member {array} [sku.locations] The set of locations that the SKU is
   * available. This will be supported and registered Azure Geo Regions (e.g.
   * West US, East US, Southeast Asia, etc.).
   * @member {array} [sku.capabilities] The capability information in the
   * specified sku, including file encryption, network acls, change
   * notification, etc.
   * @member {array} [sku.restrictions] The restrictions because of which SKU
   * cannot be used. This is empty if there are no restrictions.
   * @member {string} kind Required. Indicates the type of storage account.
   * Possible values include: 'Storage', 'StorageV2', 'BlobStorage'
   * @member {string} location Required. Gets or sets the location of the
   * resource. This will be one of the supported and registered Azure Geo
   * Regions (e.g. West US, East US, Southeast Asia, etc.). The geo region of a
   * resource cannot be changed once it is created, but if an identical geo
   * region is specified on update, the request will succeed.
   * @member {object} [tags] Gets or sets a list of key value pairs that
   * describe the resource. These tags can be used for viewing and grouping
   * this resource (across resource groups). A maximum of 15 tags can be
   * provided for a resource. Each tag must have a key with a length no greater
   * than 128 characters and a value with a length no greater than 256
   * characters.

   * @member {string} [identity.principalId] The principal ID of resource
   * identity.
   * @member {string} [identity.tenantId] The tenant ID of resource.
   * @member {object} [customDomain] User domain assigned to the storage
   * account. Name is the CNAME source. Only one custom domain is supported per

   * blob storage service.
   * @member {boolean} [encryption.services.blob.enabled] A boolean indicating
   * whether or not the service encrypts the data as it is stored.
   * @member {date} [encryption.services.blob.lastEnabledTime] Gets a rough
   * estimate of the date/time when the encryption was last enabled by the
   * user. Only returned when encryption is enabled. There might be some
