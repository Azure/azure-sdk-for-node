   * Possible values include: 'Storage', 'StorageV2', 'BlobStorage'
   * @member {array} [sku.locations] The set of locations that the SKU is
   * available. This will be supported and registered Azure Geo Regions (e.g.

   * @member {string} location Required. Gets or sets the location of the
   * resource. This will be one of the supported and registered Azure Geo
   * Regions (e.g. West US, East US, Southeast Asia, etc.). The geo region of a
   * resource cannot be changed once it is created, but if an identical geo
   * region is specified on update, the request will succeed.
   * @member {object} [tags] Gets or sets a list of key value pairs that
   * describe the resource. These tags can be used for viewing and grouping
   * this resource (across resource groups). A maximum of 15 tags can be

   * identity.
