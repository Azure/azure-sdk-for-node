  /**
   * Create a SearchResponse.
   * @member {object} [queryContext] An object that contains the query string
   * that Bing used for the request. This object contains the query string as
   * entered by the user. It may also contain an altered query string that Bing
   * used for the query if the query string contained a spelling mistake.
   * @member {string} [queryContext.originalQuery] The query string as
   * specified in the request.
   * @member {string} [queryContext.alteredQuery] The query string used by Bing
   * to perform the query. Bing uses the altered query string if the original
   * query string contained spelling mistakes. For example, if the query string
   * is "saling downwind", the altered query string will be "sailing downwind".
   * This field is included only if the original query string contains a
   * spelling mistake.
   * @member {string} [queryContext.alterationOverrideQuery] The query string
   * to use to force Bing to use the original string. For example, if the query
   * string is "saling downwind", the override query string will be "+saling
   * downwind". Remember to encode the query string which results in
   * "%2Bsaling+downwind". This field is included only if the original query
   * string contains a spelling mistake.
   * @member {boolean} [queryContext.adultIntent] A Boolean value that
   * indicates whether the specified query has adult intent. The value is true
   * if the query has adult intent; otherwise, false.
   * @member {boolean} [queryContext.askUserForLocation] A Boolean value that
   * indicates whether Bing requires the user's location to provide accurate
   * results. If you specified the user's location by using the
   * X-MSEdge-ClientIP and X-Search-Location headers, you can ignore this
   * field. For location aware queries, such as "today's weather" or
   * "restaurants near me" that need the user's location to provide accurate
   * results, this field is set to true. For location aware queries that
   * include the location (for example, "Seattle weather"), this field is set
   * to false. This field is also set to false for queries that are not
   * location aware, such as "best sellers".
   * @member {object} [entities] A list of entities that are relevant to the
   * search query.
   * @member {string} [entities.queryScenario] The supported query scenario.
   * This field is set to DominantEntity or DisambiguationItem. The field is
   * set to DominantEntity if Bing determines that only a single entity
   * satisfies the request. For example, a book, movie, person, or attraction.
   * If multiple entities could satisfy the request, the field is set to
   * DisambiguationItem. For example, if the request uses the generic title of
   * a movie franchise, the entity's type would likely be DisambiguationItem.
   * But, if the request specifies a specific title from the franchise, the
   * entity's type would likely be DominantEntity. Possible values include:
   * 'DominantEntity', 'DominantEntityWithDisambiguation', 'Disambiguation',
   * 'List', 'ListWithPivot'
   * @member {array} [entities.value] A list of entities.
   * @member {object} [places] A list of local entities such as restaurants or
   * hotels that are relevant to the query.
   * @member {array} [places.value] A list of local entities, such as
   * restaurants or hotels.
