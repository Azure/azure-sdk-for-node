   * as shown to the user. This name should be concise (to fit in drop downs),

   * entity/resource to which it applies.
   * @member {string} [description] The localized friendly description for the
   * operation as shown to the user. This description should be thorough, yet
   * concise. It will be used in tool-tips and detailed views.
   * @member {string} [origin] The intended executor of the operation; governs
   * the display of the operation in the RBAC UX and the audit logs UX. Default
   * value is 'user,system'
