   * @property {boolean} [mode] An interchangeable phrase list feature serves
   * as a list of synonyms for training. A non-exchangeable phrase list serves
   * as separate features for training. So, if your non-interchangeable phrase
   * list contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to 5 separate features. You

   * words to add to LUIS existing vocabulary features. It is used as a lexicon
   * lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a given word
   * or 0 if it doesnâ€™t.  Default value is true.
