  /**
   * Create a NetworkConfiguration.
   * @member {string} [subnetId] The ARM resource identifier of the virtual
   * network subnet which the compute nodes of the pool will join. This is of
   * the form
   * /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
   * The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
   * Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
   * addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet
   * doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate
   * compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
   * service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
   * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The
   * specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to
   * be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by
   * checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
   * (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is
   * denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute
   * nodes to unusable. For pools created via virtualMachineConfiguration the
   * Batch account must have poolAllocationMode userSubscription in order to
   * use a VNet. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security
   * Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
   * communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
   * enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389
   * for Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable
   * ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure
   * Storage on port 443. For more details see:
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
   * @member {object} [endpointConfiguration] The configuration for endpoints
   * on compute nodes in the Batch pool. Pool endpoint configuration is only
   * supported on pools with the virtualMachineConfiguration property.
   * @member {array} [endpointConfiguration.inboundNatPools] The maximum number
   * of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum number of inbound
   * NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status code 400.
