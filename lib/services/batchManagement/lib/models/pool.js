   * image. If omitted, the default is 'latest'.
   * @member {string}
   * [deploymentConfiguration.virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.id]
   * This property is mutually exclusive with other properties. The virtual
   * machine image must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure
   * Batch account. For information about the firewall settings for Batch node

   * Default value is none. Possible values include: 'None', 'ReadOnly',
   * 'ReadWrite'
   * @member {string}
   * [deploymentConfiguration.virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSkuId] The
   * Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and
   * provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch
   * service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as
   * SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU

   * empty data disks attached to them.
   * @member {string}
   * [deploymentConfiguration.virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType] This
   * only applies to images that contain the Windows operating system, and
   * should only be used when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes
   * which will be deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is
   * applied. Values are:

   * @member {number} [currentLowPriorityNodes] The number of low priority
   * compute nodes currently in the pool.
   * @member {object} [scaleSettings] Settings which configure the number of
   * nodes in the pool.
   * @member {object} [scaleSettings.fixedScale] This property and autoScale
   * are mutually exclusive and one of the properties must be specified.
   * @member {moment.duration} [scaleSettings.fixedScale.resizeTimeout] The
   * default value is 15 minutes. Timeout values use ISO 8601 format. For
   * example, use PT10M for 10 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you
   * specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service rejects the request
   * with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status
   * code is 400 (Bad Request).
   * @member {number} [scaleSettings.fixedScale.targetDedicatedNodes] At least
   * one of targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriority nodes must be set.
   * @member {number} [scaleSettings.fixedScale.targetLowPriorityNodes] At
   * least one of targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriority nodes must be set.
   * @member {string} [scaleSettings.fixedScale.nodeDeallocationOption] If
   * omitted, the default value is Requeue. Possible values include: 'Requeue',
   * 'Terminate', 'TaskCompletion', 'RetainedData'

   * are mutually exclusive and one of the properties must be specified.
   * @member {string} [scaleSettings.autoScale.formula]
   * @member {moment.duration} [scaleSettings.autoScale.evaluationInterval] If
   * omitted, the default value is 15 minutes (PT15M).
   * @member {object} [autoScaleRun] The results and errors from the last
   * execution of the autoscale formula. This property is set only if the pool
   * automatically scales, i.e. autoScaleSettings are used.
   * @member {date} [autoScaleRun.evaluationTime]
   * @member {string} [autoScaleRun.results] Each variable value is returned in
   * the form $variable=value, and variables are separated by semicolons.
   * @member {object} [autoScaleRun.error]
   * @member {string} [autoScaleRun.error.code] An identifier for the error.
   * Codes are invariant and are intended to be consumed programmatically.
   * @member {string} [autoScaleRun.error.message] A message describing the
   * error, intended to be suitable for display in a user interface.
   * @member {array} [autoScaleRun.error.details]
   * @member {string} [interNodeCommunication] Whether the pool permits direct
   * communication between nodes. This imposes restrictions on which nodes can
   * be assigned to the pool. Enabling this value can reduce the chance of the
   * requested number of nodes to be allocated in the pool. If not specified,
   * this value defaults to 'Disabled'. Possible values include: 'Enabled',
   * 'Disabled'
   * @member {object} [networkConfiguration] The network configuration for the
   * pool.
   * @member {string} [networkConfiguration.subnetId] The virtual network must
   * be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The
   * specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the
   * number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP
   * addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize
   * error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have
   * the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   * role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication
   * from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute
   * nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any
   * associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute
   * nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service
   * will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created via
   * virtualMachineConfiguration the Batch account must have poolAllocationMode
   * userSubscription in order to use a VNet. If the specified VNet has any
   * associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports
   * must be enabled for inbound communication. For pools created with a
   * virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as
   * port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For pools created with a
   * cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also
   * enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details
   * see:
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
   * @member {object} [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration] Pool
   * endpoint configuration is only supported on pools with the
   * virtualMachineConfiguration property.
   * @member {array}
   * [networkConfiguration.endpointConfiguration.inboundNatPools] The maximum
   * number of inbound NAT pools per Batch pool is 5. If the maximum number of
   * inbound NAT pools is exceeded the request fails with HTTP status code 400.
   * @member {number} [maxTasksPerNode] The maximum number of tasks that can
   * run concurrently on a single compute node in the pool.
   * @member {object} [taskSchedulingPolicy] How tasks are distributed across
   * compute nodes in a pool.
   * @member {string} [taskSchedulingPolicy.nodeFillType] Possible values
   * include: 'Spread', 'Pack'
   * @member {array} [userAccounts] The list of user accounts to be created on
   * each node in the pool.
   * @member {array} [metadata] A list of name-value pairs associated with the
   * pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to
   * metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
   * @member {object} [startTask] A task specified to run on each compute node
   * as it joins the pool. In an PATCH (update) operation, this property can be
   * set to an empty object to remove the start task from the pool.
   * @member {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
   * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such
   * as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
   * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
   * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
   * Required if any other properties of the startTask are specified.
   * @member {array} [startTask.resourceFiles]
   * @member {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the task runs as a
   * non-administrative user unique to the task.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool - specifies
   * that the task runs as the common auto user account which is created on
   * every node in a pool. task - specifies that the service should create a
   * new user for the task. The default value is task. Possible values include:
   * 'Task', 'Pool'
   * @member {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin
   * - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The
   * auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full
   * Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values
   * include: 'NonAdmin', 'Admin'
   * @member {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries a
   * task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
   * controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once,
   * and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
   * count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
   * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the task without limit.
   * @member {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start task
   * fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to
   * its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition
   * can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false,
   * the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this
   * case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start
   * task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
   * @member {array} [certificates] The list of certificates to be installed on
   * each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch
   * service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and
   * location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a
   * directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable
   * AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this
   * location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
   * directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g.,
   * /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
   * @member {array} [applicationPackages] The list of application packages to
   * be installed on each compute node in the pool. Changes to application
   * packages affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect
   * compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or
   * reimaged.
   * @member {array} [applicationLicenses] The list of application licenses the
   * Batch service will make available on each compute node in the pool. The
   * list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service
   * application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported,
   * pool creation will fail.
   * @member {object} [resizeOperationStatus] Contains details about the
   * current or last completed resize operation.
   * @member {number} [resizeOperationStatus.targetDedicatedNodes]
   * @member {number} [resizeOperationStatus.targetLowPriorityNodes]
   * @member {moment.duration} [resizeOperationStatus.resizeTimeout] The
   * default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you
   * specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error;
   * if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
   * Request).
   * @member {string} [resizeOperationStatus.nodeDeallocationOption] The
   * default value is requeue. Possible values include: 'Requeue', 'Terminate',
   * 'TaskCompletion', 'RetainedData'
   * @member {date} [resizeOperationStatus.startTime]
   * @member {array} [resizeOperationStatus.errors] This property is set only
   * if an error occurred during the last pool resize, and only when the pool
   * allocationState is Steady.
