class DeploymentConfiguration {
  /**
   * Create a DeploymentConfiguration.
   * @member {object} [cloudServiceConfiguration] The cloud service
   * configuration for the pool. This property and virtualMachineConfiguration
   * are mutually exclusive and one of the properties must be specified. This
   * property cannot be specified if the Batch account was created with its
   * poolAllocationMode property set to 'UserSubscription'.
   * @member {string} [cloudServiceConfiguration.osFamily] Possible values are:
   * 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. 3 - OS Family
   * 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4, equivalent to
   * Windows Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows Server
   * 2016. For more information, see Azure Guest OS Releases
   * (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases).
   * @member {string} [cloudServiceConfiguration.targetOSVersion] The default
   * value is * which specifies the latest operating system version for the
   * specified OS family.
   * @member {string} [cloudServiceConfiguration.currentOSVersion] This may
   * differ from targetOSVersion if the pool state is Upgrading. In this case
   * some virtual machines may be on the targetOSVersion and some may be on the
   * currentOSVersion during the upgrade process. Once all virtual machines
   * have upgraded, currentOSVersion is updated to be the same as
   * targetOSVersion.
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration] The virtual machine
   * configuration for the pool. This property and cloudServiceConfiguration
   * are mutually exclusive and one of the properties must be specified.
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference]
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.publisher]
   * For example, Canonical or MicrosoftWindowsServer.
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.offer] For
   * example, UbuntuServer or WindowsServer.
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.sku] For
   * example, 14.04.0-LTS or 2012-R2-Datacenter.
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.version] A
   * value of 'latest' can be specified to select the latest version of an
   * image. If omitted, the default is 'latest'.
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.imageReference.id] This
   * property is mutually exclusive with other properties. The virtual machine
   * image must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch
   * account. For information about the firewall settings for Batch node agent
   * to communicate with Batch service see
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration
   * .
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk]
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.osDisk.caching] Default
   * value is none. Possible values include: 'None', 'ReadOnly', 'ReadWrite'
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.nodeAgentSkuId] The Batch
   * node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides
   * the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service.
   * There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for
   * different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which
   * matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node
   * agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the
   * 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
   * @member {object} [virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration] This
   * property must not be specified if the imageReference specifies a Linux OS
   * image.
   * @member {boolean}
   * [virtualMachineConfiguration.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates]
   * If omitted, the default value is true.
   * @member {array} [virtualMachineConfiguration.dataDisks] This property must
   * be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data
   * disks attached to them.
   * @member {string} [virtualMachineConfiguration.licenseType] This only
   * applies to images that contain the Windows operating system, and should
   * only be used when you hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes which
   * will be deployed. If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is
   * applied. Values are:
   *
   * Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
   * Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
