/**
 * @summary A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure
 * Batch service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.
  *
 */
class StartTask {
  /**
   * Create a StartTask.
   * @property {string} [commandLine] The command line of the start task. The
   * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
   * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
   * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
   * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
   * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. Required if any other properties of the
   * startTask are specified.
   * @property {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the compute node before running the command line.
   * @property {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the start task.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the start
   * task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique
   * to the task.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] pool - specifies that the
   * task runs as the common auto user account which is created on every node
   * in a pool. task - specifies that the service should create a new user for
   * the task. The default value is task. Possible values include: 'Task',
   * 'Pool'
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] nonAdmin - The
   * auto user is a standard user without elevated access. admin - The auto
   * user is a user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator
   * permissions. The default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include:
   * 'NonAdmin', 'Admin'
   * @property {number} [maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of times the
   * task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is
   * nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries.
   * The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this
   * limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task
   * up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count
   * is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry
   * count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [waitForSuccess] Whether the Batch service should wait
   * for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit
   * code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the
   * start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start
   * task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
   * still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service
   * marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This
   * condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail.
   * If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete.
   * In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while
   * the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new
   * tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
