/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the ScaleRule class.
 * @constructor
 * A rule that provide the triggers and parameters for the scaling action.
 *
 * @member {object} metricTrigger the trigger that results in a scaling action.
 *
 * @member {string} [metricTrigger.metricName] the name of the metric that
 * defines what the rule monitors.
 *
 * @member {string} [metricTrigger.metricResourceUri] the resource identifier
 * of the resource the rule monitors.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [metricTrigger.timeGrain] the granularity of
 * metrics the rule monitors. Must be one of the predefined values returned
 * from metric definitions for the metric. Must be between 12 hours and 1
 * minute.
 *
 * @member {string} [metricTrigger.statistic] the metric statistic type. How
 * the metrics from multiple instances are combined. Possible values include:
 * 'Average', 'Min', 'Max', 'Sum'
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [metricTrigger.timeWindow] the range of time in
 * which instance data is collected. This value must be greater than the delay
 * in metric collection, which can vary from resource-to-resource. Must be
 * between 12 hours and 5 minutes.
 *
 * @member {string} [metricTrigger.timeAggregation] time aggregation type. How
 * the data that is collected should be combined over time. The default value
 * is Average. Possible values include: 'Average', 'Minimum', 'Maximum',
 * 'Total', 'Count'
 *
 * @member {string} [metricTrigger.operator] the operator that is used to
 * compare the metric data and the threshold. Possible values include:
 * 'Equals', 'NotEquals', 'GreaterThan', 'GreaterThanOrEqual', 'LessThan',
 * 'LessThanOrEqual'
 *
 * @member {number} [metricTrigger.threshold] the threshold of the metric that
 * triggers the scale action.
 *
 * @member {object} scaleAction the parameters for the scaling action.
 *
 * @member {string} [scaleAction.direction] the scale direction. Whether the
 * scaling action increases or decreases the number of instances. Possible
 * values include: 'None', 'Increase', 'Decrease'
 *
 * @member {string} [scaleAction.type] the type of action that should occur
 * when the scale rule fires. Possible values include: 'ChangeCount',
 * 'PercentChangeCount', 'ExactCount'
 *
 * @member {string} [scaleAction.value] the number of instances that are
 * involved in the scaling action. This value must be 1 or greater. The default
 * value is 1.
 *
 * @member {moment.duration} [scaleAction.cooldown] the amount of time to wait
 * since the last scaling action before this action occurs. It must be between
 * 1 week and 1 minute in ISO 8601 format.
 *
