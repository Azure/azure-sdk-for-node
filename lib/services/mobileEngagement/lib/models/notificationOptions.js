   * notifications on
   * Android 4.1+ devices with the following constraints:
   * * The URL length is limited to 2000 characters.

   * * The `notificationType` property must be set to `system`.
   * @member {string} [sound] iOS only. The name of a sound file in the

   * that are compatible with system sounds. The `deliveryTime` property must
   * be set to `any` or `background`.
   * @member {string} [actionText] The action text is the title of the right
