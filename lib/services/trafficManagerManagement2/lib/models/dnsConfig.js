/**
 * @class
 * Initializes a new instance of the DnsConfig class.
 * @constructor
 * Class containing DNS settings in a Traffic Manager profile.
 *
 * @member {string} [relativeName] Gets or sets the relative DNS name provided
 * by this Traffic Manager profile.  This value is combined with the DNS domain
 * name used by Azure Traffic Manager to form the fully-qualified domain name
 * (FQDN) of the profile.
 *
 * @member {string} [fqdn] Gets or sets the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
 * of the Traffic Manager profile.  This is formed from the concatenation of
 * the RelativeName with the DNS domain used by Azure Traffic Manager.
 *
 * @member {number} [ttl] Gets or sets the DNS Ttime-To-Live (TTL), in seconds.
 * This informs the local DNS resolvers and DNS clients how long to cache DNS
 * responses provided by this Traffic Manager profile.
