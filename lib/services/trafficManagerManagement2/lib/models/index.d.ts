 * @member {string} [name] Gets or sets the name of the Traffic Manager
 * endpoint.
 * 
 * @member {string} [type] Gets or sets the endpoint type of the Traffic
 * Manager endpoint.
 * 
 * @member {string} [targetResourceId] Gets or sets the Azure Resource URI of
 * the of the endpoint.  Not applicable to endpoints of type
 * 'ExternalEndpoints'.
 * 
 * @member {string} [target] Gets or sets the fully-qualified DNS name of the
 * endpoint.  Traffic Manager returns this value in DNS responses to direct
 * traffic to this endpoint.
 * 
 * @member {string} [endpointStatus] Gets or sets the status of the endpoint..
 * If the endpoint is Enabled, it is probed for endpoint health and is
 * included in the traffic routing method.  Possible values are 'Enabled' and
 * 'Disabled'.
 * 
 * @member {number} [weight] Gets or sets the weight of this endpoint when
 * using the 'Weighted' traffic routing method. Possible values are from 1 to
 * 1000.
 * 
 * @member {number} [priority] Gets or sets the priority of this endpoint when
 * using the ‘Priority’ traffic routing method. Possible values are from 1 to
 * 1000, lower values represent higher priority. This is an optional
 * parameter.  If specified, it must be specified on all endpoints, and no
 * two endpoints can share the same priority value.
 * 
 * @member {string} [endpointLocation] Specifies the location of the external
 * or nested endpoints when using the ‘Performance’ traffic routing method.
 * 
 * @member {string} [endpointMonitorStatus] Gets or sets the monitoring status
 * of the endpoint.
 * 
 * @member {number} [minChildEndpoints] Gets or sets the minimum number of
 * endpoints that must be available in the child profile in order for the
 * parent profile to be considered available. Only applicable to endpoint of
