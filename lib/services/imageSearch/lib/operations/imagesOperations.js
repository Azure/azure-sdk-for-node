/**
 * @summary The Image Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
 * back a list of relevant images. This section provides technical details
 * about the query parameters and headers that you use to request images and
 * the JSON response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to
 * make requests, see [Searching the Web for
 * Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
 *
 * @param {string} query The user's search query term. The term cannot be
 * empty. The term may contain [Bing Advanced
 * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
 * limit images to a specific domain, use the
 * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. To help
 * improve relevance of an insights query (see
 * [insightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#insightstoken)),
 * you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only
 * with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the
 * Trending Images API.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
 * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
 * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
 * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
 * header and the
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
 * header, you must also specify the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
 * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
 * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
 * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
 * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
 * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
 * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * and
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
 * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
 * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
 * apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
 * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
 * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
 * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
 * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
 * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
 * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
 * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
 * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -
 * I500 Build / GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit / 533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version /
 * 4.0 Mobile Safari / 533.1. iPhone: Mozilla / 5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1
 * like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit / 536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile / 10B142

 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
 * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
 * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
 * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
 * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
 * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
 * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
 * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
 * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
 * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
 * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
 * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
 * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
 * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
 * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
 * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
 * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
 * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
 * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
 * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
 * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
 * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
 * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
 * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
 * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
 * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
 * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
 * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
 * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
 * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
 * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
 * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
 * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
 * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
 * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
 * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
 * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
 * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
 * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
 * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
 * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
 * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
 * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
 * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
 * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
 * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
 * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
 * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
 * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
 * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
 * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
 * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
 * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
 * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
 * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
 * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
 * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
 * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
 * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
 * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
 * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
 * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
 * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
 * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
 * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
 * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
 * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
 * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
 * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
 * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.aspect] Filter images by the following aspect
 * ratios. All: Do not filter by aspect.Specifying this value is the same as
 * not specifying the aspect parameter. Square: Return images with standard
 * aspect ratio. Wide: Return images with wide screen aspect ratio. Tall:
 * Return images with tall aspect ratio. Possible values include: 'All',
 * 'Square', 'Wide', 'Tall'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.color] Filter images by the following color
 * options. ColorOnly: Return color images. Monochrome: Return black and white
 * images. Return images with one of the following dominant colors: Black,
 * Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, Orange, Pink, Purple, Red, Teal, White, Yellow.
 * Possible values include: 'ColorOnly', 'Monochrome', 'Black', 'Blue',
 * 'Brown', 'Gray', 'Green', 'Orange', 'Pink', 'Purple', 'Red', 'Teal',
 * 'White', 'Yellow'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
 * country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see
 * [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
 * list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
 * determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
 * include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
 * that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for
 * the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter
 * and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
 * languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters.
 * This parameter and the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.count] The number of images to return in the
 * response. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. The
 * default is 35. The maximum value is 150. You use this parameter along with
 * the offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
 * displays 20 images per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the
 * first page of results.For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
 * example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with the Image Search API.Do
 * not specify this parameter when calling the Insights, Trending Images, or
 * Web Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter images by the following discovery
 * options. Day: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 24 hours.
 * Week: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 7 days. Month: Return
 * images discovered by Bing within the last 30 days. Possible values include:
 * 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
 *
 * @param {number} [options.height] Filter images that have the specified
 * height, in pixels. You may use this filter with the size filter to return
 * small images that have a height of 150 pixels.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use
 * this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the first image in the
 * list of images that Bing returns. The
 * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
 * object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.imageContent] Filter images by the following
 * content types. Face: Return images that show only a person's face. Portrait:
 * Return images that show only a person's head and shoulders. Possible values
 * include: 'Face', 'Portrait'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.imageType] Filter images by the following image
 * types. AnimatedGif: Return only animated GIFs. Clipart: Return only clip art
 * images. Line: Return only line drawings. Photo: Return only
 * photographs(excluding line drawings, animated Gifs, and clip art). Shopping:
 * Return only images that contain items where Bing knows of a merchant that is
 * selling the items. This option is valid in the en - US market
 * only.Transparent: Return only images with a transparent background. Possible
 * values include: 'AnimatedGif', 'Clipart', 'Line', 'Photo', 'Shopping',
 * 'Transparent'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.license] Filter images by the following license
 * types. All: Do not filter by license type.Specifying this value is the same
 * as not specifying the license parameter. Any: Return images that are under
 * any license type. The response doesn't include images that do not specify a
 * license or the license is unknown. Public: Return images where the creator
 * has waived their exclusive rights, to the fullest extent allowed by law.
 * Share: Return images that may be shared with others. Changing or editing the
 * image might not be allowed. Also, modifying, sharing, and using the image
 * for commercial purposes might not be allowed. Typically, this option returns
 * the most images. ShareCommercially: Return images that may be shared with
 * others for personal or commercial purposes. Changing or editing the image
 * might not be allowed. Modify: Return images that may be modified, shared,
 * and used. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed. Modifying,
 * sharing, and using the image for commercial purposes might not be allowed.
 * ModifyCommercially: Return images that may be modified, shared, and used for
 * personal or commercial purposes. Typically, this option returns the fewest
 * images. For more information about these license types, see [Filter Images
 * By License Type](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309768). Possible
 * values include: 'All', 'Any', 'Public', 'Share', 'ShareCommercially',
 * 'Modify', 'ModifyCommercially'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
 * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
 * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
 * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
 * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
 * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
 * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
 * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
 * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
 * subject to change. This parameter and the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.maxFileSize] Filter images that are less than or
 * equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size that you may specify
 * is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is
 * possible that the response may include images that are slightly larger than
 * the specified maximum. You may specify this filter and minFileSize to filter
 * images within a range of file sizes.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.maxHeight] Filter images that have a height that is
 * less than or equal to the specified height. Specify the height in pixels.
 * You may specify this filter and minHeight to filter images within a range of
 * heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.maxWidth] Filter images that have a width that is
 * less than or equal to the specified width. Specify the width in pixels. You
 * may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of
 * widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.minFileSize] Filter images that are greater than or
 * equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size that you may specify
 * is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is
 * possible that the response may include images that are slightly smaller than
 * the specified minimum. You may specify this filter and maxFileSize to filter
 * images within a range of file sizes.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.minHeight] Filter images that have a height that is
 * greater than or equal to the specified height. Specify the height in pixels.
 * You may specify this filter and maxHeight to filter images within a range of
 * heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.minWidth] Filter images that have a width that is
 * greater than or equal to the specified width. Specify the width in pixels.
 * You may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of
 * widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
 * number of images to skip before returning images. The default is 0. The
 * offset should be less than
 * ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#totalestimatedmatches)
 * - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results.
 * For example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page, set count
 * to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent
 * page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for
 * multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates,
 * see
 * [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#nextoffset).
 * Use this parameter only with the Image API. Do not specify this parameter
 * when calling the Trending Images API or the Web Search API.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
 * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
 * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
 * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
 * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
 * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
 * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
 * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
 * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
 * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
 * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
 * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
 * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
 * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
 * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
 * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
 * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.size] Filter images by the following sizes. All: Do
 * not filter by size. Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the
 * size parameter. Small: Return images that are less than 200x200 pixels.
 * Medium: Return images that are greater than or equal to 200x200 pixels but
 * less than 500x500 pixels. Large: Return images that are 500x500 pixels or
 * larger. Wallpaper: Return wallpaper images. You may use this parameter along
 * with the height or width parameters. For example, you may use height and
 * size to request small images that are 150 pixels tall. Possible values
 * include: 'All', 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', 'Wallpaper'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
 * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
 * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
 * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
 * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
 * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
 * This parameter and the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
 * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
 * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
 * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.width] Filter images that have the specified width,
 * in pixels. You may use this filter with the size filter to return small
 * images that have a width of 150 pixels.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *                      See {@link Images} for more information.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

/**
 * @summary The Image Detail Search API lets you search on Bing and get back
 * insights about an image, such as webpages that include the image. This
 * section provides technical details about the query parameters and headers
 * that you use to request insights of images and the JSON response objects
 * that contain them. For examples that show how to make requests, see
 * [Searching the Web for
 * Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
 *
 * @param {string} query The user's search query term. The term cannot be
 * empty. The term may contain [Bing Advanced
 * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
 * limit images to a specific domain, use the
 * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. To help
 * improve relevance of an insights query (see
 * [insightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#insightstoken)),
 * you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only
 * with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the
 * Trending Images API.
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
 * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
 * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
 * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
 * header and the
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
 * header, you must also specify the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
 * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
 * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
 * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
 * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
 * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
 * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * and
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
 * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
 * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
 * apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.contentType] Optional request header. If you set
 * the
 * [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
 * query parameter to RecognizedEntities, you may specify the binary of an
 * image in the body of a POST request. If you specify the image in the body of
 * a POST request, you must specify this header and set its value to
 * multipart/form-data. The maximum image size is 1 MB.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
 * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
 * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
 * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
 * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
 * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
 * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
 * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
 * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -
 * I500 Build / GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit / 533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version /
 * 4.0 Mobile Safari / 533.1. iPhone: Mozilla / 5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1
 * like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit / 536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile / 10B142
 * iPhone4; 1 BingWeb / 3.03.1428.20120423. PC: Mozilla / 5.0 (Windows NT 6.3;

 * / 7.0 Mobile / 11A465 Safari / 9537.53
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
 * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
 * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
 * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
 * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
 * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
 * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
 * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
 * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
 * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
 * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
 * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
 * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
 * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
 * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
 * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
 * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
 * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
 * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
 * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
 * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
 * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
 * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
 * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
 * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
 * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
 * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
 * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
 * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
 * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
 * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
 * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
 * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
 * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
 * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
 * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
 * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
 * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
 * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
 * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
 * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
 * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
 * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
 * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
 * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
 * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
 * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
 * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
 * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
 * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
 * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
 * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
 * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
 * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
 * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
 * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
 * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
 * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
 * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
 * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
 * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
 * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
 * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
 * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
 * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
 * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
 * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
 * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
 * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
 * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.cropBottom] The bottom coordinate of the region to
 * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
 * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
 * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
 * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
 * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.cropLeft] The left coordinate of the region to
 * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
 * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
 * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
 * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
 * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.cropRight] The right coordinate of the region to
 * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
 * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
 * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
 * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
 * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {number} [options.cropTop] The top coordinate of the region to crop.
 * The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height and is
 * measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the coordinate as a
 * value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the Insights API.
 * Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or
 * Web Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.cropType] The crop type to use when cropping the
 * image based on the coordinates specified in the cal, cat, car, and cab
 * parameters. The following are the possible values. 0: Rectangular (default).
 * Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter
 * when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs. Possible
 * values include: 'Rectangular'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
 * country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see
 * [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
 * list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
 * determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
 * include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
 * that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for
 * the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter
 * and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
 * languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters.
 * This parameter and the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use
 * this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the first image in the
 * list of images that Bing returns. The
 * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
 * object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.imageUrl] The URL of an image that you want to get
 * insights of. Use this parameter as an alternative to using the insightsToken
 * parameter to specify the image. You may also specify the image by placing
 * the binary of the image in the body of a POST request. If you use the binary
 * option, see the
 * [Content-Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#contenttype)
 * header. The maximum supported image size is 1 MB. Use this parameter only
 * with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the
 * Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.insightsToken] An image token. The
 * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
 * object's
 * [imageInsightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-imageinsightstoken)
 * contains the token. Specify this parameter to get additional information
 * about an image, such as a caption or shopping source. For a list of the
 * additional information about an image that you can get, see the
 * [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
 * query parameter. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not
 * specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web
 * Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {array} [options.modules] A comma-delimited list of insights to
 * request. The following are the possible case-insensitive values. All: Return
 * all insights, if available, except RecognizedEntities. BRQ: Best
 * representative query. The query term that best describes the image. Caption:
 * A caption that provides information about the image. If the caption contains
 * entities, the response may include links to images of those entities.
 * Collections: A list of related images. Recipes: A list of recipes for
 * cooking the food shown in the images. PagesIncluding: A list of webpages
 * that include the image. RecognizedEntities: A list of entities (people) that
 * were recognized in the image. NOTE: You may not specify this module with any
 * other module. If you specify it with other modules, the response doesn't
 * include recognized entities. RelatedSearches: A list of related searches
 * made by others. ShoppingSources: A list of merchants where you can buy
 * related offerings. SimilarImages: A list of images that are visually similar
 * to the original image. SimilarProducts: A list of images that contain a
 * product that is similar to a product found in the original image. Tags:
 * Provides characteristics of the type of content found in the image. For
 * example, if the image is of a person, the tags might indicate the person's
 * gender and type of clothes they're wearing. If you specify a module and
 * there is no data for the module, the response object doesn't include the
 * related field. For example, if you specify Caption and it does not exist,
 * the response doesn't include the imageCaption field. To include related
 * searches, the request must include the original query string. Although the
 * original query string is not required for similar images or products, you
 * should always include it because it can help improve relevance and the
 * results. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this
 * parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
 * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
 * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
 * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
 * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
 * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
 * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
 * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
 * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
 * subject to change. This parameter and the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
 * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
 * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
 * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
 * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
 * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
 * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
 * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
 * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
 * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
 * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
 * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
 * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
 * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
 * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
 * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
 * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
 * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
 * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
 * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
 * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
 * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
 * This parameter and the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
 * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
 * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
 * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *                      See {@link ImageInsights} for more information.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

/**
 * @summary The Image Trending Search API lets you search on Bing and get back
 * a list of images that are trending based on search requests made by others.
 * The images are broken out into different categories. For example, Popular
 * People Searches. For a list of markets that support trending images, see
 * [Trending
 * Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/trending-images).
 *
 * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
 * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
 * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
 * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
 * header and the
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
 * header, you must also specify the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
 * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
 * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
 * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
 * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
 * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
 * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
 * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
 * and
 * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
 * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
 * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
 * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
 * apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
 * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
 * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
 * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
 * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
 * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
 * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
 * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
 * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -
 * I500 Build / GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit / 533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version /
 * 4.0 Mobile Safari / 533.1. iPhone: Mozilla / 5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1
 * like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit / 536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile / 10B142
 * iPhone4; 1 BingWeb / 3.03.1428.20120423. PC: Mozilla / 5.0 (Windows NT 6.3;

 * / 7.0 Mobile / 11A465 Safari / 9537.53
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
 * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
 * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
 * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
 * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
 * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
 * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
 * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
 * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
 * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
 * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
 * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
 * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
 * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
 * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
 * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
 * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
 * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
 * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
 * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
 * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
 * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
 * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
 * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
 * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
 * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
 * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
 * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
 * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
 * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
 * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
 * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
 * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
 * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
 * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
 * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
 * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
 * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
 * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
 * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
 * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
 * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
 * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
 * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
 * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
 * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
 * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
 * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
 * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
 * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
 * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
 * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
 * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
 * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
 * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
 * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
 * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
 * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
 * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
 * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
 * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
 * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
 * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
 * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
 * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
 * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
 * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
 * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
 * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
 * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
 * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
 * States, Canada, Australia, and China markets. If you specify this query
 * parameter, it must be set to us, ca, au, or cn. If you set this parameter,
 * you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first
 * supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that
 * language with the country code that you specify to determine the market to
 * return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported
 * language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the
 * request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
 * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
 * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
 * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
 * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
 * both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
 * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
 * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
 * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
 * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
 * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
 * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
 * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
 * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
 * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
 * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
 * subject to change. This parameter and the
 * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
 * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
 *
 * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
 * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
 * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
 * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
 * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
 * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
 * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
 * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
 * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
 * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
 * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
 * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
 * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
 * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
 * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
 * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
 * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
 *
 * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
 * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
 * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
 * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
 * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
 * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
 * This parameter and the
 * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
 * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
 * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
 * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
 * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
 *
 * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
 * request
 *
 * @param {function} callback - The callback.
 *
 * @returns {function} callback(err, result, request, response)
 *
 *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
 *
 *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
 *                      See {@link TrendingImages} for more information.
 *
 *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
 *
 *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

  /**
   * @summary The Image Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
   * back a list of relevant images. This section provides technical details
   * about the query parameters and headers that you use to request images and
   * the JSON response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to
   * make requests, see [Searching the Web for
   * Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
   *
   * @param {string} query The user's search query term. The term cannot be
   * empty. The term may contain [Bing Advanced
   * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
   * limit images to a specific domain, use the
   * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. To help
   * improve relevance of an insights query (see
   * [insightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#insightstoken)),
   * you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only
   * with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the
   * Trending Images API.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
   * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
   * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
   * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
   * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
   * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
   * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
   * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * and
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
   * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
   * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
   * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
   * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
   * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
   * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
   * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
   * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
   * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
   * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -

   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.aspect] Filter images by the following aspect
   * ratios. All: Do not filter by aspect.Specifying this value is the same as
   * not specifying the aspect parameter. Square: Return images with standard
   * aspect ratio. Wide: Return images with wide screen aspect ratio. Tall:
   * Return images with tall aspect ratio. Possible values include: 'All',
   * 'Square', 'Wide', 'Tall'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.color] Filter images by the following color
   * options. ColorOnly: Return color images. Monochrome: Return black and white
   * images. Return images with one of the following dominant colors: Black,
   * Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, Orange, Pink, Purple, Red, Teal, White, Yellow.
   * Possible values include: 'ColorOnly', 'Monochrome', 'Black', 'Blue',
   * 'Brown', 'Gray', 'Green', 'Orange', 'Pink', 'Purple', 'Red', 'Teal',
   * 'White', 'Yellow'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see
   * [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
   * list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
   * determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
   * include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
   * that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for
   * the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter
   * and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
   * languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters.
   * This parameter and the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.count] The number of images to return in the
   * response. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. The
   * default is 35. The maximum value is 150. You use this parameter along with
   * the offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
   * displays 20 images per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the
   * first page of results.For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
   * example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with the Image Search API.Do
   * not specify this parameter when calling the Insights, Trending Images, or
   * Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter images by the following discovery
   * options. Day: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 24 hours.
   * Week: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 7 days. Month: Return
   * images discovered by Bing within the last 30 days. Possible values include:
   * 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
   *
   * @param {number} [options.height] Filter images that have the specified
   * height, in pixels. You may use this filter with the size filter to return
   * small images that have a height of 150 pixels.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use
   * this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the first image in the
   * list of images that Bing returns. The
   * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
   * object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.imageContent] Filter images by the following
   * content types. Face: Return images that show only a person's face. Portrait:
   * Return images that show only a person's head and shoulders. Possible values
   * include: 'Face', 'Portrait'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.imageType] Filter images by the following image
   * types. AnimatedGif: Return only animated GIFs. Clipart: Return only clip art
   * images. Line: Return only line drawings. Photo: Return only
   * photographs(excluding line drawings, animated Gifs, and clip art). Shopping:
   * Return only images that contain items where Bing knows of a merchant that is
   * selling the items. This option is valid in the en - US market
   * only.Transparent: Return only images with a transparent background. Possible
   * values include: 'AnimatedGif', 'Clipart', 'Line', 'Photo', 'Shopping',
   * 'Transparent'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.license] Filter images by the following license
   * types. All: Do not filter by license type.Specifying this value is the same
   * as not specifying the license parameter. Any: Return images that are under
   * any license type. The response doesn't include images that do not specify a
   * license or the license is unknown. Public: Return images where the creator
   * has waived their exclusive rights, to the fullest extent allowed by law.
   * Share: Return images that may be shared with others. Changing or editing the
   * image might not be allowed. Also, modifying, sharing, and using the image
   * for commercial purposes might not be allowed. Typically, this option returns
   * the most images. ShareCommercially: Return images that may be shared with
   * others for personal or commercial purposes. Changing or editing the image
   * might not be allowed. Modify: Return images that may be modified, shared,
   * and used. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed. Modifying,
   * sharing, and using the image for commercial purposes might not be allowed.
   * ModifyCommercially: Return images that may be modified, shared, and used for
   * personal or commercial purposes. Typically, this option returns the fewest
   * images. For more information about these license types, see [Filter Images
   * By License Type](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309768). Possible
   * values include: 'All', 'Any', 'Public', 'Share', 'ShareCommercially',
   * 'Modify', 'ModifyCommercially'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.maxFileSize] Filter images that are less than or
   * equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size that you may specify
   * is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is
   * possible that the response may include images that are slightly larger than
   * the specified maximum. You may specify this filter and minFileSize to filter
   * images within a range of file sizes.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.maxHeight] Filter images that have a height that is
   * less than or equal to the specified height. Specify the height in pixels.
   * You may specify this filter and minHeight to filter images within a range of
   * heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.maxWidth] Filter images that have a width that is
   * less than or equal to the specified width. Specify the width in pixels. You
   * may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of
   * widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.minFileSize] Filter images that are greater than or
   * equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size that you may specify
   * is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is
   * possible that the response may include images that are slightly smaller than
   * the specified minimum. You may specify this filter and maxFileSize to filter
   * images within a range of file sizes.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.minHeight] Filter images that have a height that is
   * greater than or equal to the specified height. Specify the height in pixels.
   * You may specify this filter and maxHeight to filter images within a range of
   * heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.minWidth] Filter images that have a width that is
   * greater than or equal to the specified width. Specify the width in pixels.
   * You may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of
   * widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
   * number of images to skip before returning images. The default is 0. The
   * offset should be less than
   * ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#totalestimatedmatches)
   * - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results.
   * For example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page, set count
   * to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent
   * page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for
   * multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates,
   * see
   * [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#nextoffset).
   * Use this parameter only with the Image API. Do not specify this parameter
   * when calling the Trending Images API or the Web Search API.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
   * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
   * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
   * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
   * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
   * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
   * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
   * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
   * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
   * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
   * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
   * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
   * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
   * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
   * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.size] Filter images by the following sizes. All: Do
   * not filter by size. Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the
   * size parameter. Small: Return images that are less than 200x200 pixels.
   * Medium: Return images that are greater than or equal to 200x200 pixels but
   * less than 500x500 pixels. Large: Return images that are 500x500 pixels or
   * larger. Wallpaper: Return wallpaper images. You may use this parameter along
   * with the height or width parameters. For example, you may use height and
   * size to request small images that are 150 pixels tall. Possible values
   * include: 'All', 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', 'Wallpaper'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.width] Filter images that have the specified width,
   * in pixels. You may use this filter with the size filter to return small
   * images that have a width of 150 pixels.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<Images>} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   * @reject {Error} - The error object.

  /**
   * @summary The Image Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
   * back a list of relevant images. This section provides technical details
   * about the query parameters and headers that you use to request images and
   * the JSON response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to
   * make requests, see [Searching the Web for
   * Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
   *
   * @param {string} query The user's search query term. The term cannot be
   * empty. The term may contain [Bing Advanced
   * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
   * limit images to a specific domain, use the
   * [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. To help
   * improve relevance of an insights query (see
   * [insightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#insightstoken)),
   * you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only
   * with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the
   * Trending Images API.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
   * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
   * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
   * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
   * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
   * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
   * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
   * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * and
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
   * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
   * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
   * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
   * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
   * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
   * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
   * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
   * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
   * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
   * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -

   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.aspect] Filter images by the following aspect
   * ratios. All: Do not filter by aspect.Specifying this value is the same as
   * not specifying the aspect parameter. Square: Return images with standard
   * aspect ratio. Wide: Return images with wide screen aspect ratio. Tall:
   * Return images with tall aspect ratio. Possible values include: 'All',
   * 'Square', 'Wide', 'Tall'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.color] Filter images by the following color
   * options. ColorOnly: Return color images. Monochrome: Return black and white
   * images. Return images with one of the following dominant colors: Black,
   * Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, Orange, Pink, Purple, Red, Teal, White, Yellow.
   * Possible values include: 'ColorOnly', 'Monochrome', 'Black', 'Blue',
   * 'Brown', 'Gray', 'Green', 'Orange', 'Pink', 'Purple', 'Red', 'Teal',
   * 'White', 'Yellow'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see
   * [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
   * list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
   * determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
   * include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
   * that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for
   * the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter
   * and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
   * languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters.
   * This parameter and the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.count] The number of images to return in the
   * response. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. The
   * default is 35. The maximum value is 150. You use this parameter along with
   * the offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
   * displays 20 images per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the
   * first page of results.For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
   * example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with the Image Search API.Do
   * not specify this parameter when calling the Insights, Trending Images, or
   * Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.freshness] Filter images by the following discovery
   * options. Day: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 24 hours.
   * Week: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 7 days. Month: Return
   * images discovered by Bing within the last 30 days. Possible values include:
   * 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
   *
   * @param {number} [options.height] Filter images that have the specified
   * height, in pixels. You may use this filter with the size filter to return
   * small images that have a height of 150 pixels.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use
   * this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the first image in the
   * list of images that Bing returns. The
   * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
   * object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.imageContent] Filter images by the following
   * content types. Face: Return images that show only a person's face. Portrait:
   * Return images that show only a person's head and shoulders. Possible values
   * include: 'Face', 'Portrait'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.imageType] Filter images by the following image
   * types. AnimatedGif: Return only animated GIFs. Clipart: Return only clip art
   * images. Line: Return only line drawings. Photo: Return only
   * photographs(excluding line drawings, animated Gifs, and clip art). Shopping:
   * Return only images that contain items where Bing knows of a merchant that is
   * selling the items. This option is valid in the en - US market
   * only.Transparent: Return only images with a transparent background. Possible
   * values include: 'AnimatedGif', 'Clipart', 'Line', 'Photo', 'Shopping',
   * 'Transparent'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.license] Filter images by the following license
   * types. All: Do not filter by license type.Specifying this value is the same
   * as not specifying the license parameter. Any: Return images that are under
   * any license type. The response doesn't include images that do not specify a
   * license or the license is unknown. Public: Return images where the creator
   * has waived their exclusive rights, to the fullest extent allowed by law.
   * Share: Return images that may be shared with others. Changing or editing the
   * image might not be allowed. Also, modifying, sharing, and using the image
   * for commercial purposes might not be allowed. Typically, this option returns
   * the most images. ShareCommercially: Return images that may be shared with
   * others for personal or commercial purposes. Changing or editing the image
   * might not be allowed. Modify: Return images that may be modified, shared,
   * and used. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed. Modifying,
   * sharing, and using the image for commercial purposes might not be allowed.
   * ModifyCommercially: Return images that may be modified, shared, and used for
   * personal or commercial purposes. Typically, this option returns the fewest
   * images. For more information about these license types, see [Filter Images
   * By License Type](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309768). Possible
   * values include: 'All', 'Any', 'Public', 'Share', 'ShareCommercially',
   * 'Modify', 'ModifyCommercially'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.maxFileSize] Filter images that are less than or
   * equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size that you may specify
   * is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is
   * possible that the response may include images that are slightly larger than
   * the specified maximum. You may specify this filter and minFileSize to filter
   * images within a range of file sizes.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.maxHeight] Filter images that have a height that is
   * less than or equal to the specified height. Specify the height in pixels.
   * You may specify this filter and minHeight to filter images within a range of
   * heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.maxWidth] Filter images that have a width that is
   * less than or equal to the specified width. Specify the width in pixels. You
   * may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of
   * widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.minFileSize] Filter images that are greater than or
   * equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size that you may specify
   * is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is
   * possible that the response may include images that are slightly smaller than
   * the specified minimum. You may specify this filter and maxFileSize to filter
   * images within a range of file sizes.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.minHeight] Filter images that have a height that is
   * greater than or equal to the specified height. Specify the height in pixels.
   * You may specify this filter and maxHeight to filter images within a range of
   * heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.minWidth] Filter images that have a width that is
   * greater than or equal to the specified width. Specify the width in pixels.
   * You may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of
   * widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.offset] The zero-based offset that indicates the
   * number of images to skip before returning images. The default is 0. The
   * offset should be less than
   * ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#totalestimatedmatches)
   * - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results.
   * For example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page, set count
   * to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent
   * page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for
   * multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates,
   * see
   * [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#nextoffset).
   * Use this parameter only with the Image API. Do not specify this parameter
   * when calling the Trending Images API or the Web Search API.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
   * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
   * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
   * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
   * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
   * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
   * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
   * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
   * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
   * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
   * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
   * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
   * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
   * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
   * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.size] Filter images by the following sizes. All: Do
   * not filter by size. Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the
   * size parameter. Small: Return images that are less than 200x200 pixels.
   * Medium: Return images that are greater than or equal to 200x200 pixels but
   * less than 500x500 pixels. Large: Return images that are 500x500 pixels or
   * larger. Wallpaper: Return wallpaper images. You may use this parameter along
   * with the height or width parameters. For example, you may use height and
   * size to request small images that are 150 pixels tall. Possible values
   * include: 'All', 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', 'Wallpaper'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.width] Filter images that have the specified width,
   * in pixels. You may use this filter with the size filter to return small

   * that contain them. For examples that show how to make requests, see
   * [Searching the Web for
   * Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
   *
   * @param {string} query The user's search query term. The term cannot be
   * empty. The term may contain [Bing Advanced
   * Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to
   * limit images to a specific domain, use the

   * improve relevance of an insights query (see
   * [insightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#insightstoken)),
   * you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only
   * with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the
   * Trending Images API.
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
   * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
   * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
   * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
   * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
   * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
   * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
   * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * and
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
   * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
   * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.contentType] Optional request header. If you set
   * the
   * [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
   * query parameter to RecognizedEntities, you may specify the binary of an
   * image in the body of a POST request. If you specify the image in the body of
   * a POST request, you must specify this header and set its value to
   * multipart/form-data. The maximum image size is 1 MB.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
   * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
   * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
   * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
   * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
   * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
   * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
   * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
   * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -

   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropBottom] The bottom coordinate of the region to
   * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
   * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
   * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
   * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
   * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropLeft] The left coordinate of the region to
   * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
   * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
   * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
   * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
   * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropRight] The right coordinate of the region to
   * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
   * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
   * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
   * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
   * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropTop] The top coordinate of the region to crop.
   * The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height and is
   * measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the coordinate as a
   * value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the Insights API.
   * Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or
   * Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.cropType] The crop type to use when cropping the
   * image based on the coordinates specified in the cal, cat, car, and cab
   * parameters. The following are the possible values. 0: Rectangular (default).
   * Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter
   * when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs. Possible
   * values include: 'Rectangular'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see
   * [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
   * list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
   * determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
   * include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
   * that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for
   * the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter
   * and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
   * languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters.
   * This parameter and the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use
   * this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the first image in the
   * list of images that Bing returns. The
   * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
   * object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.imageUrl] The URL of an image that you want to get
   * insights of. Use this parameter as an alternative to using the insightsToken
   * parameter to specify the image. You may also specify the image by placing
   * the binary of the image in the body of a POST request. If you use the binary
   * option, see the
   * [Content-Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#contenttype)
   * header. The maximum supported image size is 1 MB. Use this parameter only
   * with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the
   * Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.insightsToken] An image token. The
   * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
   * object's
   * [imageInsightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-imageinsightstoken)
   * contains the token. Specify this parameter to get additional information
   * about an image, such as a caption or shopping source. For a list of the
   * additional information about an image that you can get, see the
   * [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
   * query parameter. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not
   * specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web
   * Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.modules] A comma-delimited list of insights to
   * request. The following are the possible case-insensitive values. All: Return
   * all insights, if available, except RecognizedEntities. BRQ: Best
   * representative query. The query term that best describes the image. Caption:
   * A caption that provides information about the image. If the caption contains
   * entities, the response may include links to images of those entities.
   * Collections: A list of related images. Recipes: A list of recipes for
   * cooking the food shown in the images. PagesIncluding: A list of webpages
   * that include the image. RecognizedEntities: A list of entities (people) that
   * were recognized in the image. NOTE: You may not specify this module with any
   * other module. If you specify it with other modules, the response doesn't
   * include recognized entities. RelatedSearches: A list of related searches
   * made by others. ShoppingSources: A list of merchants where you can buy
   * related offerings. SimilarImages: A list of images that are visually similar
   * to the original image. SimilarProducts: A list of images that contain a
   * product that is similar to a product found in the original image. Tags:
   * Provides characteristics of the type of content found in the image. For
   * example, if the image is of a person, the tags might indicate the person's
   * gender and type of clothes they're wearing. If you specify a module and
   * there is no data for the module, the response object doesn't include the
   * related field. For example, if you specify Caption and it does not exist,
   * the response doesn't include the imageCaption field. To include related
   * searches, the request must include the original query string. Although the
   * original query string is not required for similar images or products, you
   * should always include it because it can help improve relevance and the
   * results. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this
   * parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
   * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
   * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
   * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
   * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
   * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
   * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
   * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
   * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
   * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
   * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
   * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
   * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
   * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
   * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<ImageInsights>} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   * @reject {Error} - The error object.

   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropBottom] The bottom coordinate of the region to
   * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
   * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
   * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
   * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
   * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropLeft] The left coordinate of the region to
   * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
   * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
   * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
   * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
   * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropRight] The right coordinate of the region to
   * crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height
   * and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the
   * coordinate as a value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the
   * Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images,
   * Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {number} [options.cropTop] The top coordinate of the region to crop.
   * The coordinate is a fractional value of the original image's height and is
   * measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the coordinate as a
   * value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the Insights API.
   * Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or
   * Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.cropType] The crop type to use when cropping the
   * image based on the coordinates specified in the cal, cat, car, and cab
   * parameters. The following are the possible values. 0: Rectangular (default).
   * Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter
   * when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs. Possible
   * values include: 'Rectangular'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see
   * [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
   * list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
   * determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
   * include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
   * that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for
   * the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter
   * and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
   * languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters.
   * This parameter and the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.id] An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use
   * this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the first image in the
   * list of images that Bing returns. The
   * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
   * object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.imageUrl] The URL of an image that you want to get
   * insights of. Use this parameter as an alternative to using the insightsToken
   * parameter to specify the image. You may also specify the image by placing
   * the binary of the image in the body of a POST request. If you use the binary
   * option, see the
   * [Content-Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#contenttype)
   * header. The maximum supported image size is 1 MB. Use this parameter only
   * with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the
   * Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.insightsToken] An image token. The
   * [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
   * object's
   * [imageInsightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-imageinsightstoken)
   * contains the token. Specify this parameter to get additional information
   * about an image, such as a caption or shopping source. For a list of the
   * additional information about an image that you can get, see the
   * [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
   * query parameter. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not
   * specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web
   * Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {array} [options.modules] A comma-delimited list of insights to
   * request. The following are the possible case-insensitive values. All: Return
   * all insights, if available, except RecognizedEntities. BRQ: Best
   * representative query. The query term that best describes the image. Caption:
   * A caption that provides information about the image. If the caption contains
   * entities, the response may include links to images of those entities.
   * Collections: A list of related images. Recipes: A list of recipes for
   * cooking the food shown in the images. PagesIncluding: A list of webpages
   * that include the image. RecognizedEntities: A list of entities (people) that
   * were recognized in the image. NOTE: You may not specify this module with any
   * other module. If you specify it with other modules, the response doesn't
   * include recognized entities. RelatedSearches: A list of related searches
   * made by others. ShoppingSources: A list of merchants where you can buy
   * related offerings. SimilarImages: A list of images that are visually similar
   * to the original image. SimilarProducts: A list of images that contain a
   * product that is similar to a product found in the original image. Tags:
   * Provides characteristics of the type of content found in the image. For
   * example, if the image is of a person, the tags might indicate the person's
   * gender and type of clothes they're wearing. If you specify a module and
   * there is no data for the module, the response object doesn't include the
   * related field. For example, if you specify Caption and it does not exist,
   * the response doesn't include the imageCaption field. To include related
   * searches, the request must include the original query string. Although the
   * original query string is not required for similar images or products, you
   * should always include it because it can help improve relevance and the
   * results. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this
   * parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
   * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
   * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
   * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
   * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
   * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
   * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
   * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
   * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
   * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
   * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
   * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
   * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
   * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
   * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @param {function} [optionalCallback] - The optional callback.
   *
   * @returns {function|Promise} If a callback was passed as the last parameter
   * then it returns the callback else returns a Promise.
   *
   * {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   *                      @resolve {ImageInsights} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   *                      @reject {Error} - The error object.
   *
   * {function} optionalCallback(err, result, request, response)
   *
   *                      {Error}  err        - The Error object if an error occurred, null otherwise.
   *
   *                      {object} [result]   - The deserialized result object if an error did not occur.
   *                      See {@link ImageInsights} for more information.
   *
   *                      {object} [request]  - The HTTP Request object if an error did not occur.
   *
   *                      {stream} [response] - The HTTP Response stream if an error did not occur.

   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
   * meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify
   * this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
   * optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the
   * location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to always
   * specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect
   * the user's physical location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For
   * optimal results, you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP
   * header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.countryCode] A 2-character country code of the
   * country where the results come from. This API supports only the United
   * States, Canada, Australia, and China markets. If you specify this query
   * parameter, it must be set to us, ca, au, or cn. If you set this parameter,
   * you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first
   * supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that
   * language with the country code that you specify to determine the market to
   * return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported
   * language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the
   * request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
   * instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
   * Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
   * otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
   * parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
   * both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.market] The market where the results come from.
   * Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the request from.
   * However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a
   * country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
   * <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The string is case
   * insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
   * NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
   * the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
   * optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
   * Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
   * Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
   * subject to change. This parameter and the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.safeSearch] Filter images for adult content. The
   * following are the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult
   * content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
   * includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
   * request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail
   * images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
   * Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If
   * the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images
   * with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
   * not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
   * request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
   * safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
   * Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
   * response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query
   * parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the
   * site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
   * values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
   *
   * @param {string} [options.setLang] The language to use for user interface
   * strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code.
   * For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN
   * (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language.
   * Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the
   * user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.
   * This parameter and the
   * [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
   * header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
   * is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
   * interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
   * properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {object} [options.customHeaders] Headers that will be added to the
   * request
   *
   * @returns {Promise} A promise is returned
   *
   * @resolve {HttpOperationResponse<TrendingImages>} - The deserialized result object.
   *
   * @reject {Error} - The error object.

  /**
   * @summary The Image Trending Search API lets you search on Bing and get back
   * a list of images that are trending based on search requests made by others.
   * The images are broken out into different categories. For example, Popular
   * People Searches. For a list of markets that support trending images, see
   * [Trending
   * Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/trending-images).
   *
   * @param {object} [options] Optional Parameters.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.acceptLanguage] A comma-delimited list of one or
   * more languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing
   * order of preference. For additional information, including expected format,
   * see [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
   * header and the
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
   * header, you must also specify the
   * [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
   * query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
   * the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the
   * cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
   * finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses
   * an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market
   * that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
   * query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
   * [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
   * and
   * [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
   * query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
   * in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
   * response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
   * apply the specified language.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.userAgent] The user agent originating the request.
   * Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized
   * experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this
   * header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
   * browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
   * 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
   * are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;
   * MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA;
   * Lumia 822). Android: Mozilla / 5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.5; en - us; SCH -
   * I500 Build / GINGERBREAD) AppleWebKit / 533.1 (KHTML; like Gecko) Version /
   * 4.0 Mobile Safari / 533.1. iPhone: Mozilla / 5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_1
   * like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit / 536.26 (KHTML; like Gecko) Mobile / 10B142

   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users
   * with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new
   * features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a
   * user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead
   * to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
   * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
   * client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
   * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the
   * activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with
   * better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher
   * click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you
   * should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across
   * multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1)
   * the API consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
   * click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
   * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing
   * generated client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing
   * generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The
   * only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first
   * time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
   * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
   * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie
   * to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie.
   * For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to
   * persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get the
   * client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use
   * it for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you
   * include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.clientIp] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client
   * device. The IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses
   * the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although
   * optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
   * X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by
   * changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the
   * location not being anywhere near the device's actual location, which may
   * result in Bing serving erroneous results.
   *
   * @param {string} [options.location] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value
   * pairs that describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the
   * location information to determine safe search behavior and to return
   * relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The
   * following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat
   * (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude
   * must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0.
   * Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate
   * northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location,
   * in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less
   * than or equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
   * positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in
   * meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the
   * value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m
   * for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP
   * lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
   * location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1,
   * 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of
   * travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp
   * key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters
   * per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional): The
   * altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in
