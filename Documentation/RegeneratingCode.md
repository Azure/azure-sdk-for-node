# Regenerating Code

- Please execute `npm install` locally from the root of the cloned repo (This will install gulp locally for the repo).
- Please install gulp globally `npm install gulp -g`
- If you need the latest version of Autorest, then it needs to be specified in [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/blob/autorest/gulpfile.js#L59)
  * Determining latest Autorest version
    * A beta version is published every night to a myget feed . Hence, set the autoRestVersion to yesterday's date. Always increment the version of Autorest by 1 from the publicly available version on [nuget](http://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoRest/). While this doc is being written the publicly available version is 0.14.0
    * ```var autoRestVersion=0.15.0-Nightly20160219```
- Make sure you have updated the [mappings object](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/blob/autorest/gulpfile.js#L6) correctly for generating the source code for your service
- To list all the tasks execute `gulp -T` from the root of the repo
- Regenertion command options
  - If you want to regenerate all the services then execute `gulp codegen`
  - If you want to generate for your project then execute `gulp codegen --project <your project name a.k.a the key of the mappings object>`
  - If you want to use a local file then save the file locally say "D:\sdk" and make sure to have the same path as defined in the source of your porject in the mappings object. Execute `gulp codegen --spec-root "D:\sdk" --project <your-project-name>`.
- If generation is successful then you will see the generated code in the lib folder under `lib/services/<YourServiceName>`
