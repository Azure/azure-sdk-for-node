## Notice

This example has been updated to support current tooling API and more modern markup ('The Times They Are A Changin')

To see original example as it was written invoke this git command from console:
```
git checkout 1bf63bc957316182d346a43cc0add712360b338a
HEAD is now at 1bf63bc... Added myevents example.
```
