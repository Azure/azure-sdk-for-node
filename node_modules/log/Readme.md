# Log.js

 Light-weight logging for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), including a 
 streaming log reader.

## Installation

    $ npm install log

## Example

Log level defaults to __DEBUG__ however here we specify __INFO__, and the stream defaults to _stdout_:

    var Log = require('log')
      , log = new Log(Log.INFO);

    log.debug('preparing email');
    log.info('sending email');
    log.error('failed to send email');

Specifying a specific stream:

    var fs = require('fs')
      , Log = require('log')
      , log = new Log(Log.DEBUG, fs.createWriteStream('my.log'));

Instead of the log level constants, you may also supply a string:

    var Log = require('log')
      , log = new Log('warning');

 We can also use `%s` much like `console.log()` to pass arguments:
 
     log.error('oh no, failed to send mail to %s.', user.email);

## Reader

 To stream a log, simply pass a readable stream instead of a writable:

    var Log = require('log')
      , fs = require('fs')
      , stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/file.log')
      , log = new Log('debug', stream);
   
    log.on('line', function(line){
      console.log(line);
    });

Example stdout:

    { date: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 01:26:14 GMT
    , level: 1
    , levelString: 'ALERT'
    , msg: 'a alert message'
    }
    { date: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 01:26:14 GMT
    , level: 0
    , levelString: 'EMERGENCY'
    , msg: 'a emergency message'
    }

## Log Levels

 Mirror that of syslog:
 
  - 0 __EMERGENCY__  system is unusable
  - 1 __ALERT__ action must be taken immediately
  - 2 __CRITICAL__ the system is in critical condition
  - 3 __ERROR__ error condition
  - 4 __WARNING__ warning condition
  - 5 __NOTICE__ a normal but significant condition
  - 6 __INFO__ a purely informational message
  - 7 __DEBUG__ messages to debug an application
