- Deserialization now allows for case-insensitive property name lookup.

### 2.3.7 (9/26/2018)
- update min. version of request to 2.88.0. This will keep ms-rest and ms-rest-azure in sync with request dependency.

### 2.3.6 (6/25/2018)
- Removed usage of destructuring syntax for compatibility with old node.js versions.

### 2.3.5 (6/21/2018)
- Add support for x-nullable Swagger extension

### 2.3.2 (3/9/2018)
- Added support to ensure that the provided Duration is a Duration like object.

### 2.3.1 (2/22/2018)
- Added support for [de]serializing an "any" type (case when type is not present for an entity in the open api spec.). Resolves https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/2855
- Bumped minimum version of `moment`(dependency) to `2.20.1`
- Moved `RpRegistrationFilter` from `ms-rest-azure` to `ms-rest`. This fixes #2367.

### 2.3.0 (12/18/2017)
- Added support for processing formData parameters by setting the `"form"` property on the request object when the `'Content-Type'` header is `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`. This needs to be done since we depend on the [request library](https://github.com/request/request#applicationx-www-form-urlencoded-url-encoded-forms).

### 2.2.9 (12/15/2017)
- Runtime now populates polymorphic discriminator value if it is missing in both serialization and deserialization.

### 2.2.5 (11/06/2017)
- Add support for `ApiKeyCredentials`.

### 2.2.4 (10/25/2017)
- Skip the check for `object` type during serialization. If the type is required then we fail early saying that the type was required.

### 2.2.3 (10/11/2017)
- Restricting dependency on "moment" from "^2.18.1" to "~2.18.1" due to bugs in 2.19.0.

### 2.2.1 (6/29/2017)

### 2.2.0 (4/29/2017)
- Minor bug fix in `WebResource.prepare()` while processing query parameters.
- Removed native references to `Buffer.isBuffer()` and stream and replaced it with packages that are browser compatible.

### 2.1.0 (4/14/2017)

- Modified the handling of `Content-Type` request header in `Webresource.prepare()` #2126
