### 2.1.0 (4/5/2017)
- Removed the dependency on azure-arm-resource and made subscription client local to ms-rest-azure
- Added WithAuthResponse flavor login methods so that the user can get credentials and subscriptions when the Promise is resolved. These flavors look as follows:
```javascript
function interactiveLoginWithAuthResponse(options?: InteractiveLoginOptions): Promise<AuthResponse>;
function loginWithServicePrincipalSecretWithAuthResponse(clientId: string, secret: string, domain: string, options?: AzureTokenCredentialsOptions): Promise<AuthResponse>;
function loginWithUsernamePasswordWithAuthResponse(username: string, password: string, options?: LoginWithUsernamePasswordOptions): Promise<AuthResponse>;
```
where AuthResponse looks like this:
```javascript
export interface AuthResponse {
  credentials: DeviceTokenCredentials | ApplicationTokenCredentials | UserTokenCredentials;
  subscriptions: Array<LinkedSubscription>;
}
```
- Note: Moving forward, the login functionality will be moved out of ms-rest-azure into a different package. This needs to be done for us to move towards supporting an isomorphic javascript library.
